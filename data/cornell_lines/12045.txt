Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
What do you mean, four more?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
