This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
My God.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
Freddy.
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
