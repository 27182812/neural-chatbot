Very much. Now, where were we?
What kinda music do you like?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What are your turn-ons?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Turn-offs?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Do you have a fella?
