Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
And that is why I must go.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
You won't.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
