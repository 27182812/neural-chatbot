How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Oh, my, yes.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Who do you blame for that? Her?
