By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
No. Thank you. I’ll be fine...
