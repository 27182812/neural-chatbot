I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
