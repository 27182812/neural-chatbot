Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Yes.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Why can't you come...
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
You know what it takes.
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
