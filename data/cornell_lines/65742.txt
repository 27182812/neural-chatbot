Where would you like to eat?
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Coney Island??
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Right.
Then stick with Bialystock!
