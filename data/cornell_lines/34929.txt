Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Ma'am?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
