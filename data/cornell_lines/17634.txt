Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Mine?
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
