You’re moving...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
To Paris. Paris, France.
That’s the one...
So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
Not with what they pay me...
You’re not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
