A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Believe it.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Why?
Because they don't like what I want.
What's that?
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
