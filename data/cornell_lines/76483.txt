I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Any friends?
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need.
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
When... I’m told he came here...
