Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
Nope. He's your cat now.
