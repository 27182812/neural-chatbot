Yes.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
No.  But...
But what?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
What's that?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
