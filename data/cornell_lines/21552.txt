Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
I've missed you.
Are you okay?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Because ... I have to relax.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Yes, it's been a long time ...
