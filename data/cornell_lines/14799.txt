You told em? You told em it's me?
They already know it's you.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
