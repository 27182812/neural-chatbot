Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Of course.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
I have a tiny apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
You don't want me to live with you?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Mine.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
