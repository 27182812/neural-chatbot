Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
I guess I do too.
You what?
I sometimes fade out.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
You were going to get my door.
