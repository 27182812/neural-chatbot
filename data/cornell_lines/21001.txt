Bring him out of what?
My dream.
How you plan to do that?
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
What!?
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Meanwhile...?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
