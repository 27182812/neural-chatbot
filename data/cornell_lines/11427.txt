You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Now who's being cruel?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
