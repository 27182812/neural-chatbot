It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Aw, Johnny... .
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.

Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.

Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
How'd you get that.
I got it. Hot off the press.
