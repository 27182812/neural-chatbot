Hmmm...
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She never particularly cared for me.
She didn't love you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
