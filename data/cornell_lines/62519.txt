'You Duff Anderson?
That's right.
Want to talk to you.
Okay.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
Used to be. On the railroad.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Well, what d'you know?!
