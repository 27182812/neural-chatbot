Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
Did I do something wrong?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
How would you know, Brandon?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
