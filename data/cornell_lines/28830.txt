Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
How can you be sure?
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
