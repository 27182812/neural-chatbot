Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
How'd you ever get away with it?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Sure!
I never want to go back....
