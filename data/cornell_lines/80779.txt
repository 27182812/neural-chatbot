Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
What's the assignment?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
