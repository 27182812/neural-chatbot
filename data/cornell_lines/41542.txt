What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Were you followed?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Agents.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Who?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Describe him.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
No.
No, what?
That's not Carson Dyle.
Carson?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
