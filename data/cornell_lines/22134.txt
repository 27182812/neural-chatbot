Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I bet you do!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
That's brilliant.
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
