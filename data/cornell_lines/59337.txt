What about him?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
That was Peterson upstairs.
It was you who did the asking.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
I wouldn't presume to try.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
That's when it happened?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
What's the bottom line?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Could he handle a direct contact?
I don't recommend it.
