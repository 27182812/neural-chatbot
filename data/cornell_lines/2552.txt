Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
In English, Pinkerton.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Can you put men at all four?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What is that?
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
