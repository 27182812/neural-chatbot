We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
What makes you so sure?
Because...I know.
