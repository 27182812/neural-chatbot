What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
For God's sake, Lilly!
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
No.
