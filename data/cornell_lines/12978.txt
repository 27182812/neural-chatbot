Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
My God! The fork! The fork!
I'm sorry?
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
No biggie.
