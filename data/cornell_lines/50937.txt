We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
I'll be ready.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Whatever you say.
