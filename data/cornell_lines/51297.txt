Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
I'm not afraid of his words.
He is weak.
He will grow strong.
The child cannot harm you.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
