We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
I been thinkin'...
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Like a party for all our friends.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
