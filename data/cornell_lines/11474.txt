Did you talk to Paul?
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
What was it?
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
