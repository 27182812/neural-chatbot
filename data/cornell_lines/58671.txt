What is it?
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
