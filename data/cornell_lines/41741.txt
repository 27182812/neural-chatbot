Ok.

I won't.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?

Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
I can't right now.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
