Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
