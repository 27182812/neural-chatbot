I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
