Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Don't worry, I got your back.
