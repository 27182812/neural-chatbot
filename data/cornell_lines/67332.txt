You speak English!
A little.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
We are both full of shit.
Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
