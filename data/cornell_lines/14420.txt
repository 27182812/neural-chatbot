What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
Husband?
Yes—if he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Why, he'll be back.
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
