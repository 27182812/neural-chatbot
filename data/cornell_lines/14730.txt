It'll be more than that.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath.
What if he checks it?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
In a dress.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
