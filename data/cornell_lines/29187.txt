Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
No, sir.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'm not refuting anything.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Well, then, as what did you go?
