Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
