That's how he died you know.
Who?
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Jesus, you never told them?
I couldn't.
