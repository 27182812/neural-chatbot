Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
When do you think it'll be done?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
