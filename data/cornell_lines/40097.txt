I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
I like "godsend."
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
