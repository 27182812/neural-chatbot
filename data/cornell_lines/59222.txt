Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Get out of my way.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Forgive?!
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
