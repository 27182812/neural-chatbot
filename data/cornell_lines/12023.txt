Like fuck you are.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
We're getting that anyway.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
No.  We need the gig.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Sonic Death Monkey.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
