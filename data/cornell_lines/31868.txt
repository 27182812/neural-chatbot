I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
Don't you live at home?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
