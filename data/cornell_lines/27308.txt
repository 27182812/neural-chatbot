Where could you take them?
Hm?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What do you mean now?
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
