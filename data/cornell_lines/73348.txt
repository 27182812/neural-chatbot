Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.

If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Trix...
Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!
