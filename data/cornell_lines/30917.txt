Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Ray --
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
What'd you expect to hear?
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
What you call myths, we call our history.
It's not real.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
