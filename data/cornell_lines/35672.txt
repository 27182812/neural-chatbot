He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
That means you won't have a gun.
That's right.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
We split the money?
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except --
What?
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
I told you, he will.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
I was.
