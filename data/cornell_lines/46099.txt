Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
What papers?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
The evidence of what?
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
