Why did you follow me yesterday?
Excuse me?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
You felt obliged to.
As the wife of one of our party.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
