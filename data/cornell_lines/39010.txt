You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Of course I am.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
