How did you find me?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
Really?
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
Look, this is a bad time...
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I'm just on my way out...
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
