Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
