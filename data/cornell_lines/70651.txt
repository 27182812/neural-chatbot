Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
No spare.
No.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Apparently.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
