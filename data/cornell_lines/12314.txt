Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
You're a kind man to be sure.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
