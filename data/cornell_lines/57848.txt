Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?

Who killed your patient?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
