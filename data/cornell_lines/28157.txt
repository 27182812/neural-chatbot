Sun...
Yes.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Yes. Day... night.
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Three nights... two days.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I need you.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
No.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
