What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
I know.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
That's my George, always thinking.
