A visit from an old friend.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
