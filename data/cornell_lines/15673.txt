Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Yeah.
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
