It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Uh-huh.
Tell him you want to see him?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Why?
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
What do you tell Nicolet?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
