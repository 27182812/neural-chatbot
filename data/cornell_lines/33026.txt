How did you have a baby?
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
Did you want it to come out?
No.
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Why?
May I open my eyes now?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
It grew.
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Yes.
Would you like to tell me?
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
I'm afraid.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
I ate.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
I hate them.
