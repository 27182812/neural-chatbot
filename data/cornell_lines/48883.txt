You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
