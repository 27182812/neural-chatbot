Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
They'll do it.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Yeah.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
