...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Well, okay, it's -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yeah, you already said that.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Okay.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Yah.
