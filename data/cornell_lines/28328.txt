So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Define illegal.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Define love.
