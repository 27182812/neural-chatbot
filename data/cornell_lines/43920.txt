So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
They're not nice people.
