Data, are you all right?
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
What do you mean?
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
