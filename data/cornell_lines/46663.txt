What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
<u>What do you want</u>?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
