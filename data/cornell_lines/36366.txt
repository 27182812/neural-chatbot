How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
