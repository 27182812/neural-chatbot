It's you, David.
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Stop it, Jack.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
Nurse!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Nurse!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
