You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Brody's this way.
My Diary's in Berlin.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
What final challenge?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Booby traps?
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
