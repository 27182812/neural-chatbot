You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
