They'll recognize it's not your husband.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
What's going on?
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
It won't be him.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Why tell me this?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
You can't give up.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
