I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
Arlyn Page.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Don't worry.
