They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
And the blood let you out?
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Yes. They'll never find us.
