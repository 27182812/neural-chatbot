How about you?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Why?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Sure, I'll go.
I'll go with you.
Swell!
