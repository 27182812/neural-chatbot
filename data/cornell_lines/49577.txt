How about the "Hell Merchants"?
I don't like horror movies!
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Got any Ethel Merman?
