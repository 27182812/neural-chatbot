Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
Yeah, I hate them.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
