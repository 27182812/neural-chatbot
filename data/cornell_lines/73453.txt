What's the matter, Norma?
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
We've missed you too, dear.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
