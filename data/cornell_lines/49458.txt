Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Well, there's nobody special!
Fine.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
What?
Meeting ... people.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
