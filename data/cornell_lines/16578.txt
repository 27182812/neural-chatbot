You be our guest, Jack.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
I fear she's lost.
Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
