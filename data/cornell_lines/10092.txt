Hello?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
What happened to Seymour?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
How repulsive!
So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
