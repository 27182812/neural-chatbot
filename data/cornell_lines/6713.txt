I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
You need to get out more.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
