Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Come on, that's impossible.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
But if he said no before then...
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
