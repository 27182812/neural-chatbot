Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Ah. An explorer.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I heard.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
