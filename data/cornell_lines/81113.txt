Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
What are you doing here?
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
