That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
The homeless!
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
