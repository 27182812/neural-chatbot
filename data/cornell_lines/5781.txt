Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
