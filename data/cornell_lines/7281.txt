When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
