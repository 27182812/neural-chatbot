Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Can we see?
You gonna buy?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
