But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
You believe?
Yes.
You feel?
Yes.
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
