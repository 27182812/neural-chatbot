But why would they murder...
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
