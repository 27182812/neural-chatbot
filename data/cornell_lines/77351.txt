Damn it.  We lost the horses.
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
But...
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
