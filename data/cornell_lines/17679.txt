In for what?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.

What do you suggest?

It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
