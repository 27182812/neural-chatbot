And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Really?
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
What happened?
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
