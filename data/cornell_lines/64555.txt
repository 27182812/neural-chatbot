When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
