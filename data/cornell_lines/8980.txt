Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
