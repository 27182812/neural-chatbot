I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
I can already see.
How?  How can you see anything?
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
I'm turning you.
