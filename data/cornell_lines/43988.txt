I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
I knew she would intrigue you.
She needs direction... and training.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
But Wudan does not accept women.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
