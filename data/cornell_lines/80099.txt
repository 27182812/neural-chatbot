That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
