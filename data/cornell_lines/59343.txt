Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
