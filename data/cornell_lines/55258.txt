I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
What danger?
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
