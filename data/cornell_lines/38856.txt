What do you got there, Diego?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Twenty-six months.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
What's the other one?
