I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
