Bad luck to see death in the snow.
But what happened to the little deer?
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Because it can't. It's dead.
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
It got hit.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
