Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
I know.
Are you coming to my party?
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Don't you like us?
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
