So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Like Larry or Swede.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
So is the woman.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
I wanted to see who you were.
Who am I?
