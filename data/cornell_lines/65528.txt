So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
What kind of school?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
