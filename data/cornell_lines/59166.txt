I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
No, not Louis!
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
But why?
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
