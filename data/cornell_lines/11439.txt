Dead!
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For what?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Who's dead?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
What happened?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
How horrible.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
