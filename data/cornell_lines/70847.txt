How's the stock market?
Up, up, up.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
You're society girls?
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Yeah.  Real hot.
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
- Inauguration balls -
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
I beg your pardon?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
What theory?
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Tonight?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Why?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Oh?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
You collect shells?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Shell Oil?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
