I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I manage fine alone.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
I did not ask you to, did I?
