What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
You want some eggs.
Why not?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Yeah!
Where the hell is it?
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
