All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
We missed him.
You weren't hired to miss him.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I don't know.  He took it hard.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
