Are you all right?
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Paul Lamont...?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
