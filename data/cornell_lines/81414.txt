:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:Would you stop it!
:Well, they are.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
