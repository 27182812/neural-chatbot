Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Who's Captain Rob?
Just a guy I hang out with.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
Sounds like a pirate.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Yeah, he's a pirate.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Peg leg?
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Exactly! A pirate!
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
