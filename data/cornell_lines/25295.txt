What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
