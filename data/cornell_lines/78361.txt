You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Not anymore, not in the city.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Now how far would further out be?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
