I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
I... I don't follow.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
