I'm with two friends now.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Stop throwing names at me.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
What do they need her for?
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
