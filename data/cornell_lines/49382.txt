You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
No.
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
I've seen worse places.
There are no worse places.
