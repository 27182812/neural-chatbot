You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
