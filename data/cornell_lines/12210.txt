What is it like?  Being you?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
What is it you want?
All of it finished.
