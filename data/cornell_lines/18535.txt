Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Who?
Marty.
Your son Marty?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Were the lights on?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
