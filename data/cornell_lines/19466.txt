Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Why?
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
