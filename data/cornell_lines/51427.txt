It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
What're you talking about?
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
You will not hurt him?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
You do that.
