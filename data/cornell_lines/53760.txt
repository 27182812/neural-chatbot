Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Who doesn't?
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
I should.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Right.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
