Happy birthday, darling...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
Many happy returns of the day...
I get a party, don't I?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
She did...?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
Yeah... I will.
How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
What?
I love you too. Good night, darling-
See you...
