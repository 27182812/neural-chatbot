Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
