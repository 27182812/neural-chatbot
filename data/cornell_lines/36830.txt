So keep painting.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So what?
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
