Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Do I have to spell it out?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
