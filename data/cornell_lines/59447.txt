Hello, hotshot!
Hey, baby! Where are you?
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Tell me about yourself.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
To do what?
I have to see somebody.
