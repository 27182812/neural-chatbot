Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
