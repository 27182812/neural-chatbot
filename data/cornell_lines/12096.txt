I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Is that the last of it?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
It was kind of funny.
