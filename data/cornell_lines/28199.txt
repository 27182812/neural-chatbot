It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
I understand.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
What will you say about us?
I will say that we can be friends.
We can.
