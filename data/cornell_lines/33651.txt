Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Eve! My understudy...
Didn't you know?
Of course I knew.
It just slipped your mind.
