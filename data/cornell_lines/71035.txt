I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
You don't live around here, do you?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Is he here in Borderdale?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
