I came for my clothes.
Sneaking in the back door.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
I came for Paul as well.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
A dozen?
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Did you like it, dear?
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Unless she has nerve.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He knows you shattered his violin.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
He cried.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
Two hundred years old.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Hope.
