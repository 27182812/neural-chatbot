What have they told you?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Shit.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
Sure.
