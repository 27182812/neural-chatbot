I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
