Who are you and what are you doing here?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
That depends.
On what?
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's quite out of the question.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Like Job?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Why, may I ask?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Why should I?
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Mm - Hmmm...
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Very good.
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
