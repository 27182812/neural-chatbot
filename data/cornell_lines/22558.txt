This was their burying ground, Louis.
Whose burying ground?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Why? For God's sake, why?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
I guess so...but...
You want to rest a bit before you start?

Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
