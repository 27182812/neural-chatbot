Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
