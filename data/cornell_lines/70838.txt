Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Why not?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.
