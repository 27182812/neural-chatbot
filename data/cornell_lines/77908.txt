This is a business trip!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
