Oh, hi...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
How long have you been up?
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Why not?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Okay... I promise.
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
