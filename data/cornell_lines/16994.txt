Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
