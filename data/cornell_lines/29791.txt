I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Who, Laddie?
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
It was a dream, Star.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
