I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
I understand.
