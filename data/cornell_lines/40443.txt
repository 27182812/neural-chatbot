Five?
Five.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Not if you're careful.
How can you keep doing this?
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Watchers?
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
I wish you would.
It isn't important.
I'm curious, is all.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
