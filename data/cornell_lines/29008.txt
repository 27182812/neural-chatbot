Hello. What are you up to?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
