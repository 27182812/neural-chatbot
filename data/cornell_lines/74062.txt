Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Your father was a sick weirdo.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
This??
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
So I've noticed.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Even that would be an improvement.
