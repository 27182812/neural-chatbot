Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
For everyone.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I hate chickens.
