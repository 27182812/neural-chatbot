Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
You're teasing still.
