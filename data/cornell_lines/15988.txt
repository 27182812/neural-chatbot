I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
I don't have to go through with it either.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
Me too.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
That's worse.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Well, you're beautiful.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
