When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
I did not go to high school.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
I'm still poor.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
No, Mikey.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
I'm always working.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
This is work.
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
