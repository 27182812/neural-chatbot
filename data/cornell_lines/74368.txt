I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Can't hurt...
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
