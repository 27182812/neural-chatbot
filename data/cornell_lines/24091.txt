Your pen palls dead, lady.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Nick died for me....
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
...maybe I die for Nick...
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
