Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
