I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Why do you need a radio?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
That's completely crazy.
Is it?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
