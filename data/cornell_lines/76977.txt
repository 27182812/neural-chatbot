Will you wait until the chump is played?
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
