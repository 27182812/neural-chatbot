Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
It's an island.  Got to run.
