Hey, there she is...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
