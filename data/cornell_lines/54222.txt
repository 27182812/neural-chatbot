Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
They know you are Tutsi!
