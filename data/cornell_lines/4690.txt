Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
You bet!
So, did you buy a movie?
What?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Does that work?
Yeah...Seems to.
