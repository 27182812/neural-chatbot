What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Ha, ha, ha.
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
