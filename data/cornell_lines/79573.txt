Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
How do you put a price on murder?
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Make it twenty.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
How much could you get?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
