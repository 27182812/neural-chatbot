Oh, tell the story.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Gorgeous.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
To the pools?
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Oh no -- _ 14.
