It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Where did you go?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
You have trouble sleeping?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
What things?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
How did she know that?
Somebody told her.
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Did your mother see angels often?
No.
Do you?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?  Mmm?
She'd get angry.
