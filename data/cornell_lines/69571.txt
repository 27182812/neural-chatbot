What business meeting?
Look at the way I live.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
