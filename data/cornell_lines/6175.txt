Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
