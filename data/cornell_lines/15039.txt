I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
You come home with me.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
