You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
You lost Ben?!
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
