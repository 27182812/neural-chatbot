Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
What do we have to do?
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
