I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
Where exactly?
<i>Fiji.</i>
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
One.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Today.
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
<i>A month.</i>
It's the busy season.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
Why wouldn't I?
I thought you were in a hurry.
That's right.
You want to book the flight?
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
