Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
I got my sources.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I'd like to see you try.
