What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
