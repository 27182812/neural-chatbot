I quit.
You quit.
I quit the movie.
Why did you quit?
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
It's in your play.
