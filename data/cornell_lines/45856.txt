I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
I work too, but I still make time.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
When?
Before I get off work.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
Do I love you?
