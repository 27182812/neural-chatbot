What do you take me for?
I don't know what I take you for anything...
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
I never intended you to be.
Yes, you did. You still do.
