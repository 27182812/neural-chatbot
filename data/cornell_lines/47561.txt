What is thy bidding, My Master?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
I have felt it.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
Our destruction?  Who?
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He will join us or die, My Master.
