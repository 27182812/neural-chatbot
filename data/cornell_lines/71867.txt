We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Meaning?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Arrived?  From where?
Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
