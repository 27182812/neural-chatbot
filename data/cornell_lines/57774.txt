What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Wild guess.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Kevin told me you were upset.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
