Diego Delgado, please?
Allo?
Diego?  It's George.
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Yeah, I'm out.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
