But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Well—
Well, what?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
No.
I want to be near you!
