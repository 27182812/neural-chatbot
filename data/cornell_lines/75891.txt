You think?! Based on what?
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
No one follows that midrash.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
