I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
I haven't even been married once yet!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Sam, let's go get married.
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
I'll lick the stamps.
