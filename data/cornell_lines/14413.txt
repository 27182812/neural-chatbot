I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed—  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired—and it's the only thing around.
You sound like a hobo.
