Martie...don't go! Not this time.
You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I got to fetch her home...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Only if I'm dead!
