Kevin?  Do you not love me?
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
But you don't love me.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
