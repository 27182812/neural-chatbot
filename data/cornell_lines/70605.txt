I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Yes.
