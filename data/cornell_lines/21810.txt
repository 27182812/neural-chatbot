Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
