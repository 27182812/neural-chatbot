From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
So I don't shop.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
