What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
How can you do it to yourself?
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?

You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
