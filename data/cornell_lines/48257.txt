In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
Is that what you used to do?
My days are not the old days, genius.
What are they?
The recent past.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
