Who? Elizabeth?
Yes.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
No.
But you're planning to be?
I don't know. Possibly.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Not entirely.
But that was part of it?
Yes.
Like maybe a big part?
Possibly.
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
I don't know.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
