How would I get a loan, anyway?
You need collateral.
Like this?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
