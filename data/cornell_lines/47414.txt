I don't know what to say.
Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
I did.  Both.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
