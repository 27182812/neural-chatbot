Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
What do you mean?
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Show me the document that proves that.
