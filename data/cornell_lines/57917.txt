How far is it, scout?
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
What?!
Dark haired...
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
No.
Fort Edward, then?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
