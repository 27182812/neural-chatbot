It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Why wait?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
They'll learn to live with it.
