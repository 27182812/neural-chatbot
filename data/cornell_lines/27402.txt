Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
... Yes?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
... Are you joking?
