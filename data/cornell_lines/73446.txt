Hers.
Whose?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.

Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Why did she call me?
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
