I met you at my father’s funeral.
Yes.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Partially, yes.
