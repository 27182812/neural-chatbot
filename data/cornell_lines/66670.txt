Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
