What can I do for you guys?
We want some grass.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
