I came to say goodbye.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Did you break up with Charlie?
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Wait! I'll go with you!
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
