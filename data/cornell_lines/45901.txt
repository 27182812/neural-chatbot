Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Too many pizzerias already there.
Then we could try something else.
We don't know nuthin' else.
I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  I don't like being around them, they're animals.
