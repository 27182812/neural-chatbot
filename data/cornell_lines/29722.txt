Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
They would have killed this man?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
How long will that take?
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2.
