I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
Try, please, Anna--
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What do you mean?
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
What happened to her, where did she go?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
