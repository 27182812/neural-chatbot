Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
Yes, thank you.
How are the kids?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
I got surprises for everybody!
Bought at the airport.
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
