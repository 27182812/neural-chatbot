I really have to go.
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.

Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Yes.  How do you know?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
