"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.

Yes.  Indeed I did.
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
...that's what it is.

...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Because.
They got to have something that we want.

Why would they want that?
