I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
You can't.
There must be some way.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
Come here.
