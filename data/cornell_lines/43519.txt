The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
You got a suspect...
How'd you get in on the deal?
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Or the F.B.I.?
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
Give me Ruben back...
Nikko?
