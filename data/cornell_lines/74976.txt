Same as last time -- the rest after.
Where do we go?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
This is un-fucking professional.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
