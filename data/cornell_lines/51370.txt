I had no idea...
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Where?
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Why don't you sit down?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Why too late?
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
His brother came to help him.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
On a plane back to Sicily.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
You would have killed his brother?
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
