Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Around one.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Bartholomew?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Starting with his own.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
Brian.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
No.
Oh.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
You'd lie about anything.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
