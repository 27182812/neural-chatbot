Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
How'd you guess?
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
