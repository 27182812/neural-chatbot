Hey, Gallagher!
Yeah?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Sorry, boss—
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
