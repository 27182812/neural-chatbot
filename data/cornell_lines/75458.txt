I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
Have you examined them?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
