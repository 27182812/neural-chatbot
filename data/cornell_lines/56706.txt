You remember the sounds they made?
I try not to.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
You think they could talk to each other?
To a degree we never imagined.
