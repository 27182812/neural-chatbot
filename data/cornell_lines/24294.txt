What's this guy's problem?
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What're you talkin' about?
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
