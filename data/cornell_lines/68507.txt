What do you know about trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Did you request this case?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Excuse me?
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
What do you mean?
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Hmm.
What did you know about your mother?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
How is that good news?
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Oh yeah, how?
Catch him, or kill him.
