Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Where am I?
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
That's a lie. My family was here.
I'm sorry.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
