Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
You're kidding.
Would you like me to change anything?
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
