Caen?
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
You?  Leading a squad?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about the company?
Simpson.
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Beasley's dead.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Fresh out.
What about Talbot?
Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
