Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
It's gone.
