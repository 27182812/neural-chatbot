Yes, Your Highness?
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Does Luke know?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Han, we need you here.
We?
Yes.
Not you?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
And what are they, pray tell?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
