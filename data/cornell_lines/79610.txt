Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Nope.  No problems up the road.
