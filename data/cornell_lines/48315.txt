How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
