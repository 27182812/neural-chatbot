I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
She didn't even know you. .
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
You don't know the half of it.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
I taught kindergarten.
Ha ha.  No, really.
It was a long time ago.-
