You like bourbon?
Love it.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
Is that how you think of yourself?
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
You did?
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
How far do we go with this?
