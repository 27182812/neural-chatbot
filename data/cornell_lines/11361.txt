That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Dad--
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
