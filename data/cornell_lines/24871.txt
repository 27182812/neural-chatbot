I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I never thought you did.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
