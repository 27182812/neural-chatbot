Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
