Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Isn't there an easier way?
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
