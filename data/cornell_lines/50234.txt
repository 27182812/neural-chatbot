I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
John, he's got my driver's license.
What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
What?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
What...
Please, Dad, just do it.
Okay, okay...
