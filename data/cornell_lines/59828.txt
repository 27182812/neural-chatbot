No...I'll be ok for a week.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
