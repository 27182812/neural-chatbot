Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
You said you could help.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
What's in it for you?
Your help.
I already don't like the sound of this.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
