Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
So you're the new meat?
Yes, sir.
What did you do to end up here?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Thomas Mackelway.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
Sounds like fun.
