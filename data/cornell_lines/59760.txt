What are your plans?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Sounds good.
Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
