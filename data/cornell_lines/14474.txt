Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
