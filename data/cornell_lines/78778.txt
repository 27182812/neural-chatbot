Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Oh, really?
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
