Are you telling me Friedman didn’t tell you I was here looking for him?
If he had, you’d be dead.
So why didn’t he?
What do you think, huh?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
