Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Ain't it the truth?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
They're your fans, your audience-
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
