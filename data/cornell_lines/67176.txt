People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
At least around here it does.
Are you hungry?
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
You do?
