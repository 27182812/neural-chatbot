You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
What must I do?
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
