Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
