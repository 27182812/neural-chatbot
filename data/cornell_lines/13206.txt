Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Stay alive.
