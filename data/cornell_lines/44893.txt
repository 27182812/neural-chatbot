You know what really excites me about you?
What?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
I'm not?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
But...
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
