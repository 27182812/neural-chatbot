Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Sal, I want my money.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
We both do.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Do we now?
Quit bullshitting.
You don't know shit about shit.
