This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.

Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
