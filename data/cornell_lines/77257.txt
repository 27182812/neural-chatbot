I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
