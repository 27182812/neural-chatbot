You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
Shoot.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
So what's the question?
How is it possible?
