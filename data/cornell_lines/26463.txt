How do I know that's her?
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Why should she come in?
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
