Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
She says a lot of things.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Wish I had a brother like you.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
