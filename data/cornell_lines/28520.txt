"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I screwed up twice, sir.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
