I'm still here.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I have the same problem with my help.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
In this drawer....
