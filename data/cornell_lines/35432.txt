What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
