Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Any friends?
No.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
Did she ever mention any friends?
No.  Ask Irene over there.
