...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
Yes Sheriff.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
