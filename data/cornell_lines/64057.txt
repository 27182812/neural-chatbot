<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
Islamic.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The flight?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
You busted out?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
That time?
There were others.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Hejira.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
She did, huh.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Like what?
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
