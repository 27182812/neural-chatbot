I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
It's not your fault.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
