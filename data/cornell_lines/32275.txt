That don't smell like a More.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
They sure do stink.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
