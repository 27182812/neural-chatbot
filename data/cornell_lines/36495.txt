Mr. Lipnik, I –
I apologize, Barton.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
