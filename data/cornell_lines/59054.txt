You're my handsome man.
I'm a bad person.
No.  No.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
