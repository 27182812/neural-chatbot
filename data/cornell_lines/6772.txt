So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
She tells you how I've been--
--a philandering pig.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
How'd you get her out of town?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
I'll give it my best shot.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You don't.
