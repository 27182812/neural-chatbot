No... I can't!
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Paulie, please --
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
...Like you?
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
I can't go out.
Why?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
