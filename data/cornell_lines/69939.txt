The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Not in years.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Why?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
