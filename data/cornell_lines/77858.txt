A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Montana?
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
