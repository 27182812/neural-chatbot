It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Are you going to kill her?
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
