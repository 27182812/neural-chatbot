Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Shh!
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
What?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
I didn't see anything.
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
