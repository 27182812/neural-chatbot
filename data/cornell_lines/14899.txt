Get me out of here.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
What isn't happening?
Let me out of here!
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
