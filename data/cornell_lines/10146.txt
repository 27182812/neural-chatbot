What did you tell that girl?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Jesus...
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Hooray for me.
