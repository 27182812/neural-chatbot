And me? ...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
What?
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
