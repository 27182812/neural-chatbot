I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
