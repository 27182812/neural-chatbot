Do you think that's such a good idea?
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What difference does it make why I do it?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
That's a good question.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Then do it.
