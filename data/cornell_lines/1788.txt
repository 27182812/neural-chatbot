All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
