George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
