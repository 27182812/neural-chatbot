You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
Colt Peacemaker.
A .45--
He swore by it.  What?
Just wondering.
So is Buddy on your short list?
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
