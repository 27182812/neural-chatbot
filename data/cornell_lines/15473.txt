Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
