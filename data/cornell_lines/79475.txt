Hey!
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
Time.
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
