He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
