The good lord works in mysterious ways.
He sure as heck does that.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Folks'll ask question.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
