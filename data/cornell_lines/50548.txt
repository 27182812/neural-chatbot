I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Very big.
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
