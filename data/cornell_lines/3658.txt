Good gracious!  What is this?
You are going to drive to the frontier.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
As you please.
