I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
