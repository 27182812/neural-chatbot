Good shape for an old man, eh?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
That's the one.
