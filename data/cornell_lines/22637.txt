You've got sand, for a maid.
Thank you, sir.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Can I trust you?
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
