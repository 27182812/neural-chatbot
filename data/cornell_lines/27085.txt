I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I didn't expect anything.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
It was just words.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I'm trying, David.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I am truly sorry.
