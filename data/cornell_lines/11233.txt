Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Okay... thank you.
