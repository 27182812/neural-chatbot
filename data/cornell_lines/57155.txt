Kafka -- is that your real name?
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Your office is the Workmen's --
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Eight -- and seven months.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
I don't know.
Was he depressed?
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
No, I suppose not.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
We know that.
