Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Talk about Segretti--
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
There were more then.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
How grand?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
