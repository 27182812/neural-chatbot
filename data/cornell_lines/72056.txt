35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
I don't want everyone to see.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
It's all I think about anymore.
