Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
