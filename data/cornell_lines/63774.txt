I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I know what you want me to do!
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
