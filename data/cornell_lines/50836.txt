Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
I was at home.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
No.
Why don't we say we were together?
Why would we do that?
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
