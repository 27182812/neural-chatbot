Are you busy?
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Well...
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
