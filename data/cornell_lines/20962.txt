She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Where's she at?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
She took them kids with her?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
