This boat's a mess.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Why did they attack us?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
You're Australian?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
So Kurtz is alive.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
