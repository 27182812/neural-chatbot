You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I haven't.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Do you love Drew?
Come again?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I've got plenty of friends.
I don't have any.
I can see why.
