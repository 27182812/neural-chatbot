I didn't even know you had a kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
