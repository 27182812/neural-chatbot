No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Good night.
