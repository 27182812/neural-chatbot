What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
