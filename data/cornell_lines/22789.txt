It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Nebbleman.
