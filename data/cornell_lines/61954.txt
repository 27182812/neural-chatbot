Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
What do you mean??

Oh that, she just likes to play.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Harry, I really think she.....
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
