Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Why not?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Why?
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What's so important?
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
Yeah.
