Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
