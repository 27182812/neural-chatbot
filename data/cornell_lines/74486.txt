It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Chill out, dickwad.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
No problemo.
