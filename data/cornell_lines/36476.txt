I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
We gotta call the police –
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Yeah.
What do you think happened?
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
I believe you – I KNOW you. But why should the police?
