It'll be fine, yeah.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
What?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
You're moving away?  When?
Next week.
Wow, that's soon --
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
