Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Yeah. That was me.
Why?
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
You know it's okay.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
What, you mean as friends?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
I try really hard, actually...
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
It does?
