Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Recommended?
Must I speak to you in French?
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Okay. Recommended...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
