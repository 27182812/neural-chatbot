Hi Brandon.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
Oh.  Okay.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
