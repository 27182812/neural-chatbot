Morning, Sunshine...
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
