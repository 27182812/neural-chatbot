C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
I know what I saw.
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
