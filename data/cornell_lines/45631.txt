No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
Pure?
You shouldn't start now.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
My body?  What for?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
You're serious!
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Yes...
