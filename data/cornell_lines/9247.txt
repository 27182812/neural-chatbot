ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
