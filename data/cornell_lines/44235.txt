I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Is that what you think?
