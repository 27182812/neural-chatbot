I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
The good stuff.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
