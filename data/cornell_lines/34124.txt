Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

What was your name again?
Michelle.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Yes.  Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
