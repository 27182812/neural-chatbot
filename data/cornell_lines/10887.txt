That was lovely.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Anything for you.
