You were about to ask a question?
Are you--do you--
Ask it!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Dr. Woodly.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
Is anybody besides you here now?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Where's Mom?
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
I'll see.
