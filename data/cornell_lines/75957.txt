Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
What's that?  Okay. Surprise us...
