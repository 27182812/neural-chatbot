Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
I hear Alan's sick.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
You know about Adele.
What about her?
She's dying.
She died.
I talked to her two days ago.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Our Peter?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
Can he get through it?
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
About what?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
What?
The Red Sox
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
It can't be all that personal.
