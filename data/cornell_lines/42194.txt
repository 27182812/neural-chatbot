No problem with me on the Job.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Yeah.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Yeah, I'll do that.
