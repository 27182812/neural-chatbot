There was a coffin?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What was inside?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
That about sums it up.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
Yeah?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
