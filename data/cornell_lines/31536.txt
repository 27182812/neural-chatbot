The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
-- alleged crime --
-- in a context.
