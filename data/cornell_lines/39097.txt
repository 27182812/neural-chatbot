Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
Yes.
Where did you meet him?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
We dated for about a month last year.
Then what happened?
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
