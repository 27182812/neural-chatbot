Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
