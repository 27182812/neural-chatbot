Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Yeah?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
You're not serious.
I'm always serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Would I get paid?
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
