What did you say?
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
Will you men help us stop the French?
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
