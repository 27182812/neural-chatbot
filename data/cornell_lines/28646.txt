...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Let's go.
Who's the big winner?
