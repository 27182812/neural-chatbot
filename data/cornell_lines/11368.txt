What's the matter?
Give us time.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Disease?
Situation.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
