You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Uh, atomic energy?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Dynamite --
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
The sun.
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
