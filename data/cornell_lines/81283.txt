Tell me.  I can help you.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
That's not...It's not like that.
I've never even met you.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
This fence...it's so...
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
