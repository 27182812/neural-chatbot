Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
C'mon, Walter.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
It's not what you think.
Isn't it?
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
I'm not a monster.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
Don't talk like that.
