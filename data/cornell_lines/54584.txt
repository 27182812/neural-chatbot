Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
