Yes -- what is it?
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
I know what you're doing in there.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
What are you doing in there?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Will you be joining us, soon?
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Five minutes.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Goodbye.
