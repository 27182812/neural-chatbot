We gotta go back.
What?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
No way. No way.
Please, Miles, please.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
