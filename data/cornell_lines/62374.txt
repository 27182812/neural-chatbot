I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
Oh.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?

I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
What?
High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
