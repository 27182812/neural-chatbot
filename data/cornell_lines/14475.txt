Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
