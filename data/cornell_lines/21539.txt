Thank you, Fidel Castro.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
