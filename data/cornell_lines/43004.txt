Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
