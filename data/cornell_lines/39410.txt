Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
