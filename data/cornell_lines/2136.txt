Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
Where am I?
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
