This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
I thought you wanted Zammito?
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
