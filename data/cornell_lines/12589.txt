Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
