Something wrong?
Are you having an affair?
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Well, are you?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
But I'm not.
I'm not either!!
Why don't I believe you?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Always the lawyer.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
You've made your point.
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
