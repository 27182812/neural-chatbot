Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
I think I heard about that.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
