What was that?
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
It's not healthy with it closed.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
