I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
