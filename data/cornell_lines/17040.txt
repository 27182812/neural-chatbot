Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I don't know. Who do you want?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
I know people.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
You get ketchup?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
I can't eat it with mustard.
