Hello... ?
I'm here.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Okay.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
You told me to look, so I looked.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
