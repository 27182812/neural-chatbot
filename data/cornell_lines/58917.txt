Your teeth are straight.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
I don't know.
