What's the matter with you?
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
-- of what happens after we die!
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
But what becomes of our souls?
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
All right -- so it's buried with you!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
