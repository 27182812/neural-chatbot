Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I won't allow it.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
