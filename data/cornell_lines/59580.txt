Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
