Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
We cleared 22 here.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
