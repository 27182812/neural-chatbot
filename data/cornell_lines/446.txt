I speak English.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
New York.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Excuse me?
