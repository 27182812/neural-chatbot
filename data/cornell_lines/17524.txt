Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
I can see that.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
At sixty?
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
What'd I tell ya.
