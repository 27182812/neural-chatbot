Dana, are you listening to me?
Yeah, Dad.
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Okay, Dad.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
