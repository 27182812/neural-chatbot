Nice.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
