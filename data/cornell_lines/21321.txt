How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
To protect his people.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
