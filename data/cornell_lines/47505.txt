Where's my paycheck?
Have you been logging on?
What?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
