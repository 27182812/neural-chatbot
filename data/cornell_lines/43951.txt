It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're too young to understand.
You're a sword fighter too?
