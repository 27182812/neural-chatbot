Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
What are you talking about?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Good luck.
