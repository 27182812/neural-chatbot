How's it going? It's been a while...
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of things?
You know, us.
I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Really?
I miss you, Mike.
Why didn't you call?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...the Michelin commercial...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
