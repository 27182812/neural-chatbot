I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
What about Peter?...
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Who said I was going?
What?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
