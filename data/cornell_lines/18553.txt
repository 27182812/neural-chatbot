Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Nothing.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
I'd like that very much.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
I'll wait for your call.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
All right.
