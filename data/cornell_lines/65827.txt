Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
