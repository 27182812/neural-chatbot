So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Oh.  Where is this place?
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Sounds more like Aids...
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
