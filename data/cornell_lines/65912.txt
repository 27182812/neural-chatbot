I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Mother, please...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Shut up! Shut up!
