Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Six.
And how tall are you?
