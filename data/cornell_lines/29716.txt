How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
