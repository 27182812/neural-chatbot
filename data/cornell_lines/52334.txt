It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
All by yourself?
