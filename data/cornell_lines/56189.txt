You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
I don't want to talk about that.
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
