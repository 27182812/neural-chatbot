You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
