I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
No.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
I suspected that he -- well.
What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
