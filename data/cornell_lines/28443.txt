I'll relay this to CIIAC.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Its called insubordination.
Then why do I still have a badge?
