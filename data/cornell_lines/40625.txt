Sorry about last night.
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Fear and ignorance.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
