I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
How drastic?
You don't want to know.
I think I do.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
She should've known better.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
Wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
