We've got to help each other.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I can't do it anymore.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Never.
