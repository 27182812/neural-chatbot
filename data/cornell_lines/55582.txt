Good morning, sir.
Carter –– bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Yeah, very funny.
Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
