Mind if we sit down?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Detective...
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
