How much for everything.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Nah, this'll be fine.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Is there a firing range around?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
