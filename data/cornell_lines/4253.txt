Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
