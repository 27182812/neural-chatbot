I'm going to find your sister.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
But I'm not joking.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
