Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
What do you want to break?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Why?
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Let me think.
