Why did I fall on you?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
