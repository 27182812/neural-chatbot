She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
But meant her moving here.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
So, why didn't you come?
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
