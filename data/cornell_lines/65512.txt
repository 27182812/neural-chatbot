Did I wake you?
I'm up.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Why?
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
Give me twenty minutes.
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
