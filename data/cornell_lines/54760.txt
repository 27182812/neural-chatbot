Don't I know you...
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
