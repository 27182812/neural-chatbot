What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
It's good business.

It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
Yeah, sure.
