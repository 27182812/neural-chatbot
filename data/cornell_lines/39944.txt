This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
