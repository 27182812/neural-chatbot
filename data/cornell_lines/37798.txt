Did you eat?
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I was worried.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The ferret?
The iguana.
Right.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Yeah. You want a beer?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
'kay.
