Are you out of your mind?
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Annie goes to a great school.
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Jack.
