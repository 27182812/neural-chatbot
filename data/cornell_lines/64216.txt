We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Have the planes made it to China?
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
God help them.
