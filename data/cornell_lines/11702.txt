Harold?
Huh?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
No.
None at all?
Well, maybe one.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
No.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
Your studies?
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
