Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
