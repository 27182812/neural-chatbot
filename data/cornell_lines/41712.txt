Can you describe her? How old was she?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Can you get inside?
I can.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
