I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
