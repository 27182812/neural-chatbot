Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
I want my pills NOW!
It'll only take a second.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
