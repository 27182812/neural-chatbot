And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I have to go, Sam.
I can come down next week.
No.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Sam! No!
All right.
