Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
