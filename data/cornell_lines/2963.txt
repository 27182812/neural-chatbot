Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
