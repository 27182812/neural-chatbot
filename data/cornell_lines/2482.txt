Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.

But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
