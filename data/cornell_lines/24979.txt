Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
What upsets you about that?
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Yeah, I know.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
