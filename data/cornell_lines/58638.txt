Peter, where are you?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
