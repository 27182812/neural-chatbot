Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
