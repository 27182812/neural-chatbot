After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
