They're filthy, Mother.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
I know, Mother.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
