You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
How is your cold?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
So I see.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
How come?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Oh.
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
