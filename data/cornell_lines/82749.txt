Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Why is that?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Is that a fact?
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
