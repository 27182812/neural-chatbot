Whatcha doin'?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
What do you mean?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
What did Tommy say?
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Yeah, I know.
