Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I cut myself shaving.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when I breathe.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I never was.
I don't understand.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
