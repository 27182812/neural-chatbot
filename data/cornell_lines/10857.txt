Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Mr. Robinson?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
No, it's not --
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
