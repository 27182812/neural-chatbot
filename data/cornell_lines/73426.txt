No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
You'll be waiting for me?
With a wildly beating heart.
Life can be beautiful!
