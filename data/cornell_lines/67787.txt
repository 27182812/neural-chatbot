Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
