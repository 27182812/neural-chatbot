I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Yeah?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Well, you're married.
Not yet. Not married.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
