I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
