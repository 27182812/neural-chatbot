Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Where, Jimmy?
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
