Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
You were spoiled rotten.
