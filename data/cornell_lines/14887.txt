This place stinks.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
My office.
And where's Jackie?
She's been there since Thursday night.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She was afraid.
That I gotta see.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Have her bring the money here.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Call her, tell her the combination.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
You expect me to just walk in there?
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Uh-huh.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
She will.
