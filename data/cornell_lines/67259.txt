I'm not used to having a partner.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
Well we're not friends.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
Fine with me.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
See you in the next world.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Fine.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Yes.  We have heaven.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
What's a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
I think we should stop talking.
Fine by me.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
No.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Mind your own business.
How was the sex?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
No mu-shu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Steamed dumplings?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Are you serious?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
