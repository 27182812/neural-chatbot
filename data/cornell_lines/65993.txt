Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
