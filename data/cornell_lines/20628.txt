You did all this for me?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I'm sorry to hear that.
