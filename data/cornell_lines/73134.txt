Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
No, I'm not worried.
Good.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Yeah.
Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, no.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
No.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
I know, man.
You know?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What, they're looking for her?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Y- s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Buff...
What?
She's dead.
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Bullshit.
No, no, no.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
