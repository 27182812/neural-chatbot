Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
