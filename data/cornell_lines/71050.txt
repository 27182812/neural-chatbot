You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Yes mam...
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
But where is my daddy!?
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
Nothin'...
And so you did your job, right?
Yes, mam...
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
What do that mean?
Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
