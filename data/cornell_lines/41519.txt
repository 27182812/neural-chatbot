You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Can you remember anything at all?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
With whom? Where?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Of course there is!
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
