I don't believe a thing she just said.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
I have no idea.
You think Lorenson kills you?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Why?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
