I think she's lying.
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
This is different.
Why?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
