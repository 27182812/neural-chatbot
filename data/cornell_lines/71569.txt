So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
You know who I am?
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
