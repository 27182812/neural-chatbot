So whenever we want...
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
So you're our own private guy?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You know my pager number?
No. What is it?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
