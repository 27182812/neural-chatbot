So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
I think you'll do very well.
