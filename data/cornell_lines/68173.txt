Morning.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
I'm fine.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
I know that.
