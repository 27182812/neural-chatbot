Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
