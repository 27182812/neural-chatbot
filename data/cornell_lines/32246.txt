Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
What brand'd she smoke?
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
