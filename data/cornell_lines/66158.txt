Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
