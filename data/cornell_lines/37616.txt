Will you be leaving now, Robert?
In a day or two, yes.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
