See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
