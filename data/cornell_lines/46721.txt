I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Say what?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
