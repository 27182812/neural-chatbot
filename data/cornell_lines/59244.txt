The food doesn't please you?
It's lovely.  It's just...
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.

Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
You would do that, your Majesty?
My dear, I've already done it.
