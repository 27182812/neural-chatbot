I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I accept. Now get out.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Get out!
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
And if I don't?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
War it is.
