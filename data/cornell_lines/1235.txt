I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
