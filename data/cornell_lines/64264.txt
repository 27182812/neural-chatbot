There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
