What happened to your hand?
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
