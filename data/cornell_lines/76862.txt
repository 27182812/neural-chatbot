You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Naw, it's okay.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
