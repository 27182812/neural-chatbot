These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Okay. You don't have to though.
