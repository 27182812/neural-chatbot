What'd he say?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I believe what he said.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
How do you know what they're doing?
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
What are you talking about?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Words can hurt very much.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Don't put yourself out.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Good night.
