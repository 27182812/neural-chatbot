What was here, Mr. Rodd?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
An old woman and her grandson.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
