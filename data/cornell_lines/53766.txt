Do you have a family?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
You must value your independence.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
