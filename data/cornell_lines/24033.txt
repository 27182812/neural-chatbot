Is he your friend?
Yes.  My best friend.
What's he like?
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Okay.
