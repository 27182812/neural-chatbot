Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
Yeah, poor bastard.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Buzz off.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
No, South Georgia.
What the hell's there?
Polar bears.
Polar bears in Georgia???
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Oh...
The world's southern most reaches.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
