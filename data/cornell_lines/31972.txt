John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
You got it.  What's happening?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
