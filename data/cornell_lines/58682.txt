I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
How many weeks are you honey/
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Well I know he's come here before.
What's his name?
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You just call?
I didn't know what else to do...
