Well?
Ahh, she will be yours.
When!?
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
The moon is almost gone!
Ahh, there is yet time.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
I understand, Master
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
There are others.
Well then let us proceed.
