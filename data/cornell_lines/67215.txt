Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
