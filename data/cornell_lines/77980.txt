Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Somebody's got to do it--
Well, let's hear the poem--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Very good, Mary--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
What's the matter, Mary?
I'm getting seasick--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
