Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
I'm down.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But...
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
