We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
I like to watch.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
I want to tell Eve.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes.
Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
