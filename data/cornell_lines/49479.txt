Can I have my desk please.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
