So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
What happened?
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
