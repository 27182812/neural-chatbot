Two hours at prayer!
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
