He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
He likes her.
Does he love her?
Probably.
Do you like her?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Why?
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Really?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
My Dad was funny?
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
