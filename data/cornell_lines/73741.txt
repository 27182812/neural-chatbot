Sonofagun! Look at this here!
First paycheck?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
