Where are we going, Donald?
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Then how is time travel possible?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
When will this happen?
Soon. Time is almost up.
