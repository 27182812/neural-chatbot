Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
Why?  Are you German?
No.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
This was your garden?
Or my wife's.
Then you were married?
I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
