Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Perk, remember?
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Fair enough.
