What did she want?
I did her hair.
What were you talking about?
Nothing.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
And that was all?
No. She asked about the trademark.
What did she want to know?
She showed me a drawing.
You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
