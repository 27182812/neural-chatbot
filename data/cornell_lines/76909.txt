You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
