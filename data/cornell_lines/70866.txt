Look at all that silverware.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Where's your shell collection?
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
What's on Thursdays?
It's the crews' night off.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Completely.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
You're flattering me.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Harmless - how?
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
What thing?
They just sort of leave me cold.
You mean - like frigid?
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Have you tried?
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
