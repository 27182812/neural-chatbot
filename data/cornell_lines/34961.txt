Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Who?
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
Baxter.
What's her first name?
Miss.
