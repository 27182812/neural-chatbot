I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
And where is she?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
So, you come here all by yourself?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
... Oh ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Yeah.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Moscow.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
You mean it's dangerous?
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
