I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Six.
Got any plans?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
What if I told you not to?
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
