Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's not mine.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
