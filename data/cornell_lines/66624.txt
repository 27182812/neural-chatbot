Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Did you hear what I said?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
