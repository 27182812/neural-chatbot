Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
A thousand.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Is that your third question?
It is.
You done your math right.
