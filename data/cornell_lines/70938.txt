Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
No.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
And Kat was fully clothed.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
