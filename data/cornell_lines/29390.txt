So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Yes.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
You like me, huh?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
What did it say?
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
