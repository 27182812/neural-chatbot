Who did it?
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Tell me.
