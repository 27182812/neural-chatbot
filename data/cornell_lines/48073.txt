Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
It wasn't like that.
No?
No.
What was it like?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
That how you see it?
