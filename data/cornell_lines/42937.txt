Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
Two, two-fifty.
I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
