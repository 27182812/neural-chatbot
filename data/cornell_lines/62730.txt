And we really do have to talk.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I had to limit your options.
And Linda...
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
I think you're full of shit.
No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
