Josephine -
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Well, I'll come back later.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
