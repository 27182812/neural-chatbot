Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Yes, your honor.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
I do not, your honor, however--
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Then I have concluded my questions.
