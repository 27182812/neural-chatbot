The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Into what?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Just be cool.
