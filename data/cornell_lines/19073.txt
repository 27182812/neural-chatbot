It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
That it is.
