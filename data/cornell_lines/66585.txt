Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Where're you off to now?
