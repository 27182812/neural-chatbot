You heard about your father?
Yeah.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
No, just you and Paulie.
