I want to fly, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
No, sir!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Pity you don't have the character.
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
