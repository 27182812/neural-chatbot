Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Ok, whatever you want.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
No, I was looking at you.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
Oh, for her show?
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Oh.
You're possessive.
I know.
