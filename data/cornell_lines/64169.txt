Fun today.  Like old times.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
No.  You're trying to beat me.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
