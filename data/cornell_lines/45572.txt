So!  Sal is with you?
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I know I am.  I know!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Would you do something for me? Please?
What?
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Shit...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Yeah.
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
I don't have a choice.
You don't have a choice?
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Look... who's on the phone?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
They won't talk to you.
Are they on the phone still?
Yeah... yeah!
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
That's good then.  You've found something.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Do you still want the operation?
Yeah... yeah.
Well, then...
It's my only chance!
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Right.  See you sometime.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
