What do you want?
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
What plan?
Just get him to stop.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Yes.
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Her oxygen would have run out.
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
