Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
No -- not yet.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
