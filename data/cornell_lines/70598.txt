Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Carl Heine came.
