You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
I expect to try.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
