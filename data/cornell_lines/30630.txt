Have you been up all night again?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Meaning?
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
