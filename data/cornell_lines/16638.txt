The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Sunlight, you say?
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
