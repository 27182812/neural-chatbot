How you doing down there?
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Watch out for them air pockets!
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
We back in Metropolis?
No...I just have a little stop to make.
