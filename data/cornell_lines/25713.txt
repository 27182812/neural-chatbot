Do I know you?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
This is the story.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
They are alive, Sayer.
