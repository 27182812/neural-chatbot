And you, are you in love with any one else?
No.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Of course.
Were you in love with any of them?
No.
Were they pretty?
Yes.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
One had better legs.
Were any of them married?
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
She must have been in love with you.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
