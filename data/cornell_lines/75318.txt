No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't understand.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Would you mind showing it to me?
