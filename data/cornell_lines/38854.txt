If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
What?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I don't want to talk about it.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Not really, no.
No?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
