Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
