Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
I've got it.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Right here.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
