Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
I don't know.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Okay, okay. Okay.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Yeah.
