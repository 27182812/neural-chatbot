What the fuck are you doing here?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Why'd you come here?
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
What for?
A ticket home,
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
No.
