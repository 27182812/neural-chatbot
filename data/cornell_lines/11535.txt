Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
How important do you think sex is?
Not very.
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
