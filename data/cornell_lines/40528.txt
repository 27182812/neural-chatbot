No!  You're playing with my mind!
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
I think you're real cute.
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
