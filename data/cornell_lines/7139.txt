You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
What do I get?
You get half mine and I get half yours.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
