You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?

And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
That's where the what comes in.

You can't be more specific than that?
