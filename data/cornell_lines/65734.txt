See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
But what if the play was a hit?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
What scheme?
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
