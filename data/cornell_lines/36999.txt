I need the Wayne Diamonds.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
