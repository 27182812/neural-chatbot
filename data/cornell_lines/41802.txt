That's my business.
No argument there.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
Since when does...
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Since today.  New policy.

Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.

Well, he told me to collect cash.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...moron.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
Uh, huh?
Except for the fact that I need cash.
He could've called first.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
...and fair...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
Oh.
Why don't I--?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
