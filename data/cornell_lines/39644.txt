I need a ride.

I need a ride out of here.
Oh, Jesus...
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
Get the fuck away from my car.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
You don't want the police any more than I do.
