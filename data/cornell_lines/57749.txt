Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
I'm sorry.
