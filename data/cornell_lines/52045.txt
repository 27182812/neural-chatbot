Yeah?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
Sounds good, where are you now?
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
