There seem to be quite a few books.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
This is the only library I know of.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
