"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
How?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
