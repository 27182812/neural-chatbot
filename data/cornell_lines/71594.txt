This is a vicious cycle.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Kinda tough on the butt.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
Whoa.
It's a vicious cycle.
