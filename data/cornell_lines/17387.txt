We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
