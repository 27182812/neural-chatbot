I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
