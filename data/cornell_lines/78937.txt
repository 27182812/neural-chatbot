Did you say Group 7 access?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Did he say why?
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Okay, okay...
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
I mean I want both of us to go.
