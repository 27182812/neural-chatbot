They are beautiful.
Yes, they are.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
But...
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
