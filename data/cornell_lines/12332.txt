I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
