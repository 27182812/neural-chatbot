Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
