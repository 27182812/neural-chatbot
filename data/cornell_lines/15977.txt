The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
You really haven't seen my best side.
