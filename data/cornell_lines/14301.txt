I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Yes, I know—but—
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
What ten thousand?
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward!
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
You're a peculiar chap.
We'll go into that some other time.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Yeah—with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
