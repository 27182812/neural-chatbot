What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
