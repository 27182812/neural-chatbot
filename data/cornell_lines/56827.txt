So what's your story, Nick?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
