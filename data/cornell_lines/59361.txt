Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
What's one way?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
No other possibilities?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Why?
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
See? You do know something about him.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
