Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
Fuck you.
