I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
You're not?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
