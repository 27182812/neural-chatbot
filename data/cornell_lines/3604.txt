I never had a really real pair before.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
You sing and dance?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
What do you mean?
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
