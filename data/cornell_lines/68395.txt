A twist ending if you will.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
So we found a compromise.
Or it found us.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Just for you, Sid.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
