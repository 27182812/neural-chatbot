What happened?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
For what?
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
