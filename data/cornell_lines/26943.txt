I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
