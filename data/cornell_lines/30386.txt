How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
