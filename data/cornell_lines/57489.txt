What are you going to do?
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
