He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
You gave him the money?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
