What the hell is that?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
No, I just assumed...
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
No, sir.
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
