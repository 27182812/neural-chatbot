It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
