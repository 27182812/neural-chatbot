What are you doing on Theo's line?
Taking messages.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
