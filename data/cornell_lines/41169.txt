Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
How much time do you have left on it?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
A woman?
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
And that was the end of it?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Well you did.
