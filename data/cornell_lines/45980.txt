Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Sucks for you.
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
