Who told you to wear men's clothes?
The clothes are not important...
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
I... submit to Our Lord.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
