Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I guess I ain't.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
I doubt it.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I guess not.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
