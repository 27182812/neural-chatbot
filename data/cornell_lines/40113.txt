I've got another story.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
