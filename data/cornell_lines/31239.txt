Harry from work...He was the boss.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
You went to those brain butchers?!
Let me finish!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
--I got a trip to Mars.
Oh God, Doug.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
They did!  But I killed them!
