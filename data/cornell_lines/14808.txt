Who's paging you?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
