Sir, that is true.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
