I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
