You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
