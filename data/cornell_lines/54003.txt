Talley?
I'm here.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I'll give you these people.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
