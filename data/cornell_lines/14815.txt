You okay?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
