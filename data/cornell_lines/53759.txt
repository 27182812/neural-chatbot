And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
As long as you keep remembering why.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
I understand that.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
No, no, no, no.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
That would be stupid.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
-- a sense of proportion.
A sense of proportion.
