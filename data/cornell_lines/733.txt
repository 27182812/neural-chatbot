Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
