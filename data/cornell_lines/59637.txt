I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Really?
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
How many were there?
Five.  Since I've been here.
What happened to them?
Dead.  All dead.
How?
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
