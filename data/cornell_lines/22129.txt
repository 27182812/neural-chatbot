Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
No. Is that what you want?
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
What would you do differently?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Your real father?
