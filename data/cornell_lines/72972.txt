This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
That's nonsense, and you know it!
I know nothing of the sort!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require?  You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
