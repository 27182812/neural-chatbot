It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
