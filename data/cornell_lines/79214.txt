Wow. What a swell place to work.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
How long have you worked here?
Almost four years.
That's a long time.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
Do you get paid a lot?
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
You bet. How much is that worth?
