Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Tennessee?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well. What kinda job is it?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
You mean a farm?
No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
