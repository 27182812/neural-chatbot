A chicken?
No.  But you're close.
A rooster?
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
You really don't know who I am?
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
