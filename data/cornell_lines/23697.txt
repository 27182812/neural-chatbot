It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Yeah. At night.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Three more, I figure.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
