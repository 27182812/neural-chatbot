You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
But that's Simone's part.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
