So that's how we stand, Baron.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Be quiet.
I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat!
