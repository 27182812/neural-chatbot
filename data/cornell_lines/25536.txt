Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Where's the pinto going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
South of here, past Chimayo.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
