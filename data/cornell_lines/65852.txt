He didn't come back here?
Sam.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Where could he have gone?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Without calling me?
In a hurry.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Yes. I think he would have.
