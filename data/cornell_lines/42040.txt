I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
My daughter.
What about her?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
