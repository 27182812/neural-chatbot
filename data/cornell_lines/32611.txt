You always carry these?
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
It's just a city park.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
Try.
I can't.
I bet you can.
