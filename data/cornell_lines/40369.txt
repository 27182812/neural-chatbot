I don't understand.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
No, you didn't.  When?
Didn't you get my message?
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home.  Like always.
You left me a message?
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
