Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.

I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
