She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
English muffin.  How do you do it?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
-- a slice of pizza --
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
I'm starting to notice that.
