You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.

Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
I want him with me.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
