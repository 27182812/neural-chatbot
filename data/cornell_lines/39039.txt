Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Like cats and dogs.
What did they argue about?
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Did they argue the day before he died?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
What was the nature of the argument?
Sex.
Could you be more specific?
