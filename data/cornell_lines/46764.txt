I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Bud White's been here?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
No.
Not good enough.
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
