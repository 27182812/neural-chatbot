I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
What do you want, a joke?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
