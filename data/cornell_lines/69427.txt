No. I haven't seen them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Same as everyone else.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Yes.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I suppose so.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Sorry?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
