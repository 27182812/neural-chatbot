Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Not now, Mom, please.
What'll you do?  Come out.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
Oh.  Run.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Maybe...
Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?
