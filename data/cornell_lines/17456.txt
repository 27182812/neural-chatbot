Better.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Okay. Thanks.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Yeah.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
What night is that?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
