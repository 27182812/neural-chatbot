Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
I'm sure you are.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I'm not nervous.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
