Good evening ... Can we pass?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
But it's not even midnight yet!
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
