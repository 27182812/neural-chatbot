Oh, my god.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
How? When?
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Jesus.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Number six.
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
No, you're not.
Why not?
It's today.
What!?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
You hardly knew her!
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
You hate people.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
If you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you!
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
I can't close the store.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
