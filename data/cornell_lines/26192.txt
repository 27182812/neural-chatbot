Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
