Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
So. There we are.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Here... In the park?
Right.
