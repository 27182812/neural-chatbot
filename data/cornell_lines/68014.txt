Good luck, Captain.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
The men said, nine.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
That only leaves three.
Plenty.
