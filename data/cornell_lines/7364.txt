Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
You don't love ME.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
What -- rape?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
What?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
