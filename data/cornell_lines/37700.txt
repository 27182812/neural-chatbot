Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Hello, Ronald.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
I can't write.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
I can't read.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Yes. I like to watch.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
What sort of bed is it?
