Good night, papa.
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?

One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
