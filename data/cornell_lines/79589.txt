You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
She's dead.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
Oz.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
You're too quick for me.
