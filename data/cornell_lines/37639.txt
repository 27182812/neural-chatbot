May I ask your name?
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
