What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Okay, okay.
Don't con me.
What do you do with your time?
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
That's what Mama used to say.
Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
