We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
