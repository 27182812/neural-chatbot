White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
