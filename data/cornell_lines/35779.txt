They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Damn!
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
What happened?
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
You're kidding.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
WE gotta think of something.
Now you're using that word.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
