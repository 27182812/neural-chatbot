What are you doing here?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
Well, here I am.  See?
How are you doing?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Dad.
What?
You can call me Dad if you want.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Do what you want, it's a free country.
