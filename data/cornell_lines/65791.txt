So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
