Who else ?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.

Fair enough.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They'll love it in Pomona.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
I am not afraid.  Read it!
