He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
