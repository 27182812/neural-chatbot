I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The United Nations are still here.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
What did you overhear?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
What did they say?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
