I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
