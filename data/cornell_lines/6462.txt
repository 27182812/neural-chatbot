You trust this Moonan guy?
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
It's just insurance.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm down!
