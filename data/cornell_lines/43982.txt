Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Yes.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
I left the training early.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
You were enlightened?
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
What was it?
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
