Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Uh-huh.
Does this sound weird?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
What kind of Cancer?
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Oh, she's fine.
Oh that's good.
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
Sure is.  So why call me?
