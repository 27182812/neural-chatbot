I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
Out of the question.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
