So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Do you know that for sure?
It's mine.
