I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're supposed to guess.
