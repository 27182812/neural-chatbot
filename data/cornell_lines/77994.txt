All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
I wish I could.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
