I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
But why?  The students love us!
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
I see.
