That's quite an array of ribbons...
Let's talk about you.
I was an FO for the 25th.
Tracks ?
Yeah.
Fat. That's real fat.
Sometimes.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
We do.
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
