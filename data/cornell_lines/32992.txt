Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
You know, I don't love anybody.
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
