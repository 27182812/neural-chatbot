Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
He working for them on this one?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
What?
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
