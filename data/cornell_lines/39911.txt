I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
