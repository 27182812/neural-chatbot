You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Sure am.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
How come?
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
