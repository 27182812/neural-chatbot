My card.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Then I demand an apology!
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.
What did you say to her?
