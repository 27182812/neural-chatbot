In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
