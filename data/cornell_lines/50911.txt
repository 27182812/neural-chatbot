Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Texas is a big state.
I can handle it.
I'll bet you can.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
