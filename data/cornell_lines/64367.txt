What happened to you?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
