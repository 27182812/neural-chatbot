When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
