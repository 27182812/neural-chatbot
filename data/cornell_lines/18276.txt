Let's talk about you for a change.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
I can handle it.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
You have enough worries of your own.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Why do you ask?
Just an idle question.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
