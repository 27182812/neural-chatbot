Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
