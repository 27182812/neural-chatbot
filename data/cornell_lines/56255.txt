I know how to tag a damn conch....
The readings suck....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Hey!
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
