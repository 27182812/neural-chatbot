I had it all on tape...
What did you do then?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
What happened with the tape?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
