I wanna hear about it, George.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I wanna hear about it.
What can I say!
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
I'm not anti-Establishment.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
