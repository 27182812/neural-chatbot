I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.

Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
