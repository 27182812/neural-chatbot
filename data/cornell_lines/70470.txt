How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
It'll never be finished.
Huh?
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
