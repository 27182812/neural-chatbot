Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
We'll miss you so.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.
