Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
