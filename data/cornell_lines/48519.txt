I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
But you always seem so certain.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
That’s a big one for me, too.

Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
