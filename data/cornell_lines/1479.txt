Elaine.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, we have to go back.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
