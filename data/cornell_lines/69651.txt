Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
Don't be silly.
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Nothing.
It must be something.
Well, it's George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
We don't think marriage is important.
But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
