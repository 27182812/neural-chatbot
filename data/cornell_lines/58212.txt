Hello, can I help you?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I can't help you, Plank.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
