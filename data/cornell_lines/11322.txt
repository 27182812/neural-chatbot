You know what gets me?
Go home!
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
The hell with the diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Can I have the Cadillac?
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
Go home!

Go home.
I'm liable to find anything!

I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.

You know what gets me?

How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
