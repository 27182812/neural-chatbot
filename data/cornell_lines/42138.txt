She's too upset.
What about?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
You mean she just found out?
Yes.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
What does it look like?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
You're insane.
