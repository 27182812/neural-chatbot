They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Did they take your clothes?
No.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
No.
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
What about jewelry?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
The blender?
I love my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
No, but they took my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
What?
They only took electrical appliances.
Serve the ball.
