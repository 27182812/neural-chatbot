You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
You believe that?
I don't know. I really don't.
