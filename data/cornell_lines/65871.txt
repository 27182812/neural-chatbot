Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
We could laze around here a while longer.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Sam!
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Sam. This is the last time.
For what?
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Can you?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
