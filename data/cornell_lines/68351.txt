Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
That's okay.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Where is everybody?
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Why aren't you there?
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
That's too bad.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
What if I said you?
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I'm inquisitive.
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
