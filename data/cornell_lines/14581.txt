Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
