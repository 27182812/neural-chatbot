Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
I don't know.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
Mulder --
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
