Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
You told him that?
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
