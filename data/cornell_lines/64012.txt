Oh, God...
I called your room from downstairs.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
It would be worth the risk.
