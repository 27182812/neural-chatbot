We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
So you did fuck up.
Yes.

What do you mean?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
You're never out, Fergus.
