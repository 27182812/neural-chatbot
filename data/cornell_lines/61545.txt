Someone's shut off my money!
I know.  Where are you Adam?
What do you mean "you know"?
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
And?
You're broke!
But I'm not broke.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
