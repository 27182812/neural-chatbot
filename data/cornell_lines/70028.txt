Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
