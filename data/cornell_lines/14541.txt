This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
