Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
