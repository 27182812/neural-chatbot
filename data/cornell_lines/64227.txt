It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
I'd take better care of my teeth.
