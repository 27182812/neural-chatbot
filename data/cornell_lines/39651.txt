Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
