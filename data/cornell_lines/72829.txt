Consuelo?
Yes, Mikey?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes.
Really? How many?
Four brothers and five sisters.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
It was God's will.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
No.
