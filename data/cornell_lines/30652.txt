I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
