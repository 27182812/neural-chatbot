You still call it ratting?
Are you on the level, Father?
What do you think?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Down to the wire?
So help me God!
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
