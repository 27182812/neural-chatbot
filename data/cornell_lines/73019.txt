I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
And you'd like to see that?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Do you think we'd cheat?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Do you think they would cheat?
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
