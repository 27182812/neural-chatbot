Hello?
We got disconnected before....
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I need help.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend --
-- you said you did.
I know I did. But I don't.
You lied to me?
I didn't lie.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
No you won't.
