What happened here?
The radio's on the fritz.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Why?
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
