I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Ah, there's the rub...
There's the rub.
