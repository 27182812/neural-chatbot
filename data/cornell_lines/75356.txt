Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
--a dead one at that.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
That and a fat, new contract.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Amnesia.
Of course.
