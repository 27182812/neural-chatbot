I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm worried about Jake.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
