Austin, may I have a word with you?
Of course, luv.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
