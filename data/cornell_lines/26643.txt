Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
My legs are frozen.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
Sefton!
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Not you.
What some brandy?
Yeah.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
What are the chances busting out of here?
We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
