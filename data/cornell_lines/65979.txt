What! What are you talking about?
The body of Joan Gale!
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Are you giving me this straight?
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
