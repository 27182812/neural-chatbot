Both pilots!
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely you can't be serious.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
