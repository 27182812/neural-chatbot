Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I remember her.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
