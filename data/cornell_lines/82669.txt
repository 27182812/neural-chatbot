I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
No.  I just wanted you to --
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Good night.
