How's the job coming, Bob?
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
We'll see about that ...
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
