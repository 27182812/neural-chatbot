Attorney for the plaintiff?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
On behalf of the defendants?
