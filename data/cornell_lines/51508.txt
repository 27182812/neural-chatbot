My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
The Great War?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
