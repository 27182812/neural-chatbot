What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
You look upset.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
I'm tired.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.
Then don't bug me.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Mid-town mostly.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Oh?  Where you going?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
