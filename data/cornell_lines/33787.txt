Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Really, Eve? Why?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Why not?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
