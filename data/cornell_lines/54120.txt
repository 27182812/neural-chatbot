When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
These disks . . . where are they?
Smith will know.
