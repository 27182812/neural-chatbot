I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Why'd you come here?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
You didn't know about it before that?
No.
