Why do we always stay here?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.
Exactly.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
All right, all right. We'll go.
When?
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
