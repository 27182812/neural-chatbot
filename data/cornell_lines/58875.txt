You visiting?
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
So...how's the knee?
Getting there.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
