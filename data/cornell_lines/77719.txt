Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Don't you mean work me?
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
