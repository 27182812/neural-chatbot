I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
You're leaving tomorrow?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
