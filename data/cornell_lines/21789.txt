Where you headed, Betty?
Los Angeles, California.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Did you love it?
Sure I loved it! It was great.
