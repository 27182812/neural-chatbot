I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
