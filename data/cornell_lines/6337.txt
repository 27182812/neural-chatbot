Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
No. Just confidence.
