Oskar - my friend Lena.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Now you're back.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
