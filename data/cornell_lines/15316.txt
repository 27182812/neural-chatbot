What is all this stuff?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
