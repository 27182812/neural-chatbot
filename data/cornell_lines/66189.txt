Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Oh, no, sir.
