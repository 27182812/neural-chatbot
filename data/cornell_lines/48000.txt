Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Save your servant
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
In the face of the enemy.
