What's vermin again?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Nicole?
Yes.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Okay.
