Are you Klingman?
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
Right here.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You said you were Klingman.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
Get out of my hotel.
