I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
They want more time to think about investing.
Goddamnit.
They just said they wanted time.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
