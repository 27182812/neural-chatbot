Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
What's the matter?
Sweeney.
Dead?
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
No!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Keep away --
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Get away, Svengali.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I'm not working for any other paper!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Look at this!
