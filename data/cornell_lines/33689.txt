It's obvious you're not a woman.
I've been aware of that for some time.
Well, I am.
I'll say.
Don't be condescending.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Margo, let's make peace.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
It's not nonsense.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I wish it were.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
