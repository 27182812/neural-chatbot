Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
