If you were in love with me, would you?
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
That's very flattering.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
