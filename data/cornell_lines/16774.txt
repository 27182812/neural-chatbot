I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
I'm coming in.
I don't want you to!
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
