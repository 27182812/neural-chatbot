I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
This is real, Bananahead!
So?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
