Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
