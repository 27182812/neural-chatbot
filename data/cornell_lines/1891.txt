I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Really?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Then he didn't send you?
No, sir. This is my own idea.
I see.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
