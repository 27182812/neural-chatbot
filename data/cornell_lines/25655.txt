This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Not if I don't let her.
You?
