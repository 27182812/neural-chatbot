My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
But I did live.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Some think not.
Who?
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Me father has taken back my hand.
