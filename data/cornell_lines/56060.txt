Besides that.
I don't know, what else is there?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Come on, it's fun!
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
No, think of something else.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
