You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
I agree.
