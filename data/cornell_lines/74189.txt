Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
From what?
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
You talked about it?
No.  I saw it on his face.
