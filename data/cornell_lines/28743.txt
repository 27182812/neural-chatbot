I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
