Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax....
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
