You're fucked.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
They're not very imaginative?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Not before I settle with you.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
