The box... you opened it. We came.
It's just a puzzle box.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Who are you?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
