I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
What have you been before today?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Do you remember?
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
