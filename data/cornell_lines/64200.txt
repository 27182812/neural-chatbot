Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
