What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Is her husband sick or something?
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
