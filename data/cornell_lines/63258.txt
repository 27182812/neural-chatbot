Any more announcements?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
