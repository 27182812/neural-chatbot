Turn up your hearing aid.
What?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Oh. Did you say something?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
