Now...when do I get a taste?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
