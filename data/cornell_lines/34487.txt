Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
