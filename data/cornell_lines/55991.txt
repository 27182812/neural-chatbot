Where are you going?
Up.
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I talked you into this?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Are you coming...?
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
