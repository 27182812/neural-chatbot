Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
