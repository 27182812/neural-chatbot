We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Oh no.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
How is he these days?
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Does he ever mention me?
No.  Not that I can recall.
