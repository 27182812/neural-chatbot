You the owner here?
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
All right if I look around your lobby?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
