You coming in?
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.
Shooting?
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
