He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
