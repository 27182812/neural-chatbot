Why did you kill Friedman?
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
Why did you kill him?
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
That’s just it. The sonofabitch didn’t ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn’t gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
