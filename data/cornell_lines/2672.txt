So, what's the topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, I'm okay.
