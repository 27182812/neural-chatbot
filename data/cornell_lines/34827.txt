You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Not nice.  Not kind.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Why are you doing this?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
