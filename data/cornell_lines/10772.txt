Aren't you?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's all right.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Sit down.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Very much.
