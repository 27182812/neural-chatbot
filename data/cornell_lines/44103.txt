I read your teen beat manifesto.
You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Oh really?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
How do you know I've been with several women?
A friend wrote me.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
