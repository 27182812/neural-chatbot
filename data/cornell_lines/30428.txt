Thelma.
Yeah.
I want you to call Darryl.
What for?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
It won't work.
Why not?!
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
