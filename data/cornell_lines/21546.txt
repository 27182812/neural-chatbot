Dick, you should call Bobby.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You don't have to go.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
