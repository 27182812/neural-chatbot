You were gone a long time.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
So he's doing okay?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yes.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Lila...
