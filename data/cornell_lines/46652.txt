I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Yeah.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
