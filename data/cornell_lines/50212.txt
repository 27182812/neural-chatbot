What are you talking about?
I lost you.
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
Fire.
On the job?
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
It did, Pop.  It did.
When?
October 12, 1969.
