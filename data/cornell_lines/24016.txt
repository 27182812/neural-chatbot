You cold?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Neither can I.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
No.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
