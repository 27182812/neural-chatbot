I know.
If you went away, what would become of me?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I can't help it.
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
