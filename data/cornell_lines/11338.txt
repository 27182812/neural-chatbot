I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Our pleasure.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Blue soup.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
