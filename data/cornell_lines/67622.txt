It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.

Destiny takes a hand.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.

It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
