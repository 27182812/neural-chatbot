I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
If I can smoke it.
You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
