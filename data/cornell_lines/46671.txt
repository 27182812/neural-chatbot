Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
What are you talking about?
It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
