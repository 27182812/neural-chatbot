Do I know you?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
You don't understand.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Will you let me explain!
And what're you whispering for?
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
