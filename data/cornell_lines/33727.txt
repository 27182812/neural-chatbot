You all put together?
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Late for what?
Don't be dense. The party.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
