You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
I'm sorry.

No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Yeah...
