You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
No, they don't, do they?
