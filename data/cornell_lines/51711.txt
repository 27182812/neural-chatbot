You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
Hey, now -
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You?
Me.
You?
Me...
