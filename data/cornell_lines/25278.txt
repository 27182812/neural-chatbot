Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Count me out.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
