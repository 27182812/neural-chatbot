Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
1959.
Who use to own it?
Russia.
When did we get it from them?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Sorry, that's the largest city.
