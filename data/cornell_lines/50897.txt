... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
For exits off Main Street.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
