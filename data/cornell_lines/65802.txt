Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
What have you done, LSD?
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
I mean in show business.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
What do you do best?
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
