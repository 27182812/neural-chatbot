I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
