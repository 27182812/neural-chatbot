Now, please, Swana.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
