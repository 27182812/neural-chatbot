What d'you want?
What?
What you got me up here for?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
You want me to leave?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
I'm going to Florida.
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
