Why did you come back here?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
And, what about us?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
