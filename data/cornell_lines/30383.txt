Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
Okay.  I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
