Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.

Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
