What're you saying, Charlie?
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Twelve years.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
So?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
