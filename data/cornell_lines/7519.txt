So you like bookstores, huh?
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Sort of, um...
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
What?
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
