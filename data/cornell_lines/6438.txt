Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Can't say.
Then who's the Banker?
The King.
