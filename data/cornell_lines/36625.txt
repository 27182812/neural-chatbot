I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
Did you like her to watch?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
Everybody that I care about dies.
