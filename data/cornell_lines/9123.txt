The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
