<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Can you scare them off?
