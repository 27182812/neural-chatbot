...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.

Huh?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
But... Betsy...
I'm getting a taxi.
