Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
So your memory's coming back?
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
In His name??
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Really?
