So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
How do we prove it?
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
