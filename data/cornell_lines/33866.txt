You get quick action, don't you?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
But what could she do?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Well...
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Promise.
I promise.
That's my Max.
