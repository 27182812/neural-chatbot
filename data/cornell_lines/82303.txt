What's so funny?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
God, Fred...
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
No? Why not?
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
