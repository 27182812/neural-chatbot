Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hm.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
