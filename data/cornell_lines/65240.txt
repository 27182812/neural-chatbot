Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Fuck off.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
You're a piece of shit
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
