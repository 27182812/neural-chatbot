Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
Now, Lisa --
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Do you think I consider this recreation?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
What is it you're looking for?
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
Maybe she died.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
