No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Hi. Good.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Well, I've been busy.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
You can't talk to me like...
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Sam?
Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
