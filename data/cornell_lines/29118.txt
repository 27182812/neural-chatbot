Thank you.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake?  Oh Jesus...
