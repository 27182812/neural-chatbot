The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
How do you survive?
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.

No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
