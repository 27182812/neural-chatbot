Hand me the 3/8ths.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When I think you're ready.
When will that be ?
When you are ready.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
Trust is earned not given away.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
No.
