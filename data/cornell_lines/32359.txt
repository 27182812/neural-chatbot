He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
