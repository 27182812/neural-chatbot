Are you still in love with me?
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You don't ever think about other people?
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
