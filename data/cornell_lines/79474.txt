It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
