Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Nobody else had it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
That's okay.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
