Hon.
What.
Have a good day at work today.
Uh-huh.
Hon?
What?!
You want anything special for dinner?
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
