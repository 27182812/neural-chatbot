There were witnesses?
So they said.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
