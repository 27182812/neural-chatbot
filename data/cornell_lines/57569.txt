I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Always.
