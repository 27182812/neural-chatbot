You ever try solitary confinement?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
