God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I'm just being realistic.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I hate sports.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What about Joe?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
Yeah, well I like you too...
