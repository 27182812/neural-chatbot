Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
No, Mr. Charles.
How did you get in here?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
You worked here?
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Trying to put it off on her?
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
Police!
