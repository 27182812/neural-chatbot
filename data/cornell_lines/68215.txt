Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
No, we don't have to say it.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
Say what?
