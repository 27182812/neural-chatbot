It was sinking.
What was?
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Bye bye blackbird.
Is that what she used to sing?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I don't know.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I'm starting to forget her.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
