Pretty girl.
If you like 'em like that.
You got types?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
