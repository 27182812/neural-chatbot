Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Yes I do...
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
What a nasty thing to say.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
