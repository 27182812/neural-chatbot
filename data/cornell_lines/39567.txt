Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Shit, here we go.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't understand - ?
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
We're not that different, Corky.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Because it's the truth.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
I don't.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
What you heard wasn't sex.
What the fuck was it?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What was it then?
Work.
