Who?
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
She's with me.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
