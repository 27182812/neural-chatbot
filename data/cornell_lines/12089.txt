Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Yeah.  Great.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Fine.  One.
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Is what better?  Better than what?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Of course it is.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
Never?
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Will you please just go?
