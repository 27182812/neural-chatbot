Can we come in?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
You don't look so good.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
