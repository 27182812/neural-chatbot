You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
What were you doing in my room?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
