Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I'd be honored.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
And am I not fair?
Wondrously so.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
How so?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
And sweet?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
