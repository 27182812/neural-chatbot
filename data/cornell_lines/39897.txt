My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
Not as good as Nino's.
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.

They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
You married?
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
