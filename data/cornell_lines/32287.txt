Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You got me, peanut.
You certain?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
I do.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
