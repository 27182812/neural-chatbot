The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
That's right. Three percent.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
A real bargain.
