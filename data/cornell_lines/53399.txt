Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Don't talk to me like that.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
No.
Jealous much?
