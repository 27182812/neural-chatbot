Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Is he in the bathroom?
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Oh. What?
Very big spider.
Yeah?
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
