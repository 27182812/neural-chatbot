Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I'm not appealing the decision.
Then why are you here?
