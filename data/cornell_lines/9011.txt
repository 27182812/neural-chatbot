All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Oh, really.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Pardon?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
