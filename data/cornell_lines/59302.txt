Why did you set me up?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
No.  A witness.
What exactly did you see?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
No, but I'm listening.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
