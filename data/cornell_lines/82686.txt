No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Old?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
. . . What?
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
