Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
You did not ask me.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
