Say, you got a lulu.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Oh, I never catch colds.
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
That makes me feel just terrible.
Why?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
That's me.
