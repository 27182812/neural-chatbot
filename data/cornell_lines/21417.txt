Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
I expect more from thee, Richard.
