Are you serious?
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
We have to do something.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
I know, I know....
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
It's still a good idea.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Two of them are still missing!
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Maybe they are!
