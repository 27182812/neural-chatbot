Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I can't believe you do me this way.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
