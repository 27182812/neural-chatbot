Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
I want out of this marriage.
What?
I want out of this marriage.
Why?
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
