D'you find an apartment?
Still looking.
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Laura.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
