You're fucked in the head.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
