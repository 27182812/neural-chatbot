Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
I don't know.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
I don't know.
Do you know them.
Not very well.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
I think that'll be fine.
