You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Yes.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
Yes.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
I tried to pay you off.
Was that Swann's idea?
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
