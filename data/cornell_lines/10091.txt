Look, we have to get these...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
You're insane.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What thing?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
