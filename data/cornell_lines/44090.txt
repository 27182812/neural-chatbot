An unexpected pleasure.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Who got himself what?
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
