I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
You were right. He found me.
And you're working with him?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
Does one exist?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
