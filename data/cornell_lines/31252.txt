You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
I'm not interested in that.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
