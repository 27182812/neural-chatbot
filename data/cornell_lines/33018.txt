Agnes, did you love your mother?
Yes.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Like you?
