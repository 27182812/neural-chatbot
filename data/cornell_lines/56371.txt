I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
Three or four.
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Once.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
That's bullshit,
He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
