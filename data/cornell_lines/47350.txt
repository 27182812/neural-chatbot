I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
