You can't take her away from here!
Why not?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
She came here in 1888!
