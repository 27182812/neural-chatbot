So did you do it?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No, did you fuck him?
No. I don't think so.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
And then?
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
At least your PMS is over.
And my bra finally fits again.
