Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Phreak?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
You think they're going to bust us?
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
