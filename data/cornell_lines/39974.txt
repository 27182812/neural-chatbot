How <u>you</u> doing?
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?

You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Oh, stop it.
