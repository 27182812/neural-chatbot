What do you think?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
