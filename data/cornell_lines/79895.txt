Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?

I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?

Scouting?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
Three days? I must be.
