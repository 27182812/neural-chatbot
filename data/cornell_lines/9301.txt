U.... What do you think?
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
... What does that mean?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Covalent... Right. So...
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
OK!
