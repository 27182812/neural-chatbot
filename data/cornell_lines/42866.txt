You like being a lawyer?
You psychic?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Bottega.
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
