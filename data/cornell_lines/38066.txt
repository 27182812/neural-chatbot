What happened to your house?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Finder's fee?
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
