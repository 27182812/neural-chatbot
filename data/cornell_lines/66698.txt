So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
