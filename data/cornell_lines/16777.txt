I was wondering.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
Not really.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Okay.  I guess.
