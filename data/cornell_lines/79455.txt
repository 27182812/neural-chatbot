You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That a fact?
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Maybe I do.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Think you'll live that long?
