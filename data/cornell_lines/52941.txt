Well, thanks a lot.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
