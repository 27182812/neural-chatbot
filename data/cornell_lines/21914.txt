What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
David Ravell.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
