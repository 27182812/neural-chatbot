I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
