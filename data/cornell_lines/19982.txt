I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Uh-huh.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
What's that?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Why's that?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
