Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Perhaps.
