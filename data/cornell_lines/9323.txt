Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Your last name.
Yeah, what is it?
It's... I don't know.
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
