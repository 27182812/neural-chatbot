Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
Where the hell is he?
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
So ... let's go ...
He told me to take you to his conference room.
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
Then his office will be fine.
