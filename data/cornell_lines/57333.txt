Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Town Police.
Then how are you involved?
I know Tom Grunemann.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
We grew up together. Kids.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
No.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
No.
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
