You picked up that girl right in front of me.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
It still hurt.  A lot.
I didn't mean to...
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
You liked it too.
Sure.  I loved it.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
You mean us?
