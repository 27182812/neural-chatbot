Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
