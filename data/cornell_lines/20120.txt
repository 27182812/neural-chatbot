This is great!
This is exactly what I wanted.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
