Goodbye, Paul.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
