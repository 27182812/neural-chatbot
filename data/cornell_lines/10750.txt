Hello.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Benjamin?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Where are you?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Where are you?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
What?
I'll be there in an hour.
