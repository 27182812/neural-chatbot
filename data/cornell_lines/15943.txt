Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
What are they, please?
