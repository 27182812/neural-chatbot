No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
I've come now...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
