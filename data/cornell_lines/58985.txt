Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
This sounds threatening.
Do you have love in your heart?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Is it real love?
Well --
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
I have love.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
