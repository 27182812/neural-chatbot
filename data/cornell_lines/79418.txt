They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
