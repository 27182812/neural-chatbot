That's a very handsome sword you have there.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
