Time marches on. Ardor cools.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Ah.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
I don't know. I can assume...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
