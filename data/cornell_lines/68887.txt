How was it?
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
