Hey... so, what brings you down here?
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
What are you trying to say?
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
