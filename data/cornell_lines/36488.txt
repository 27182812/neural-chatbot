...Where did we put him?
I'm at the Earle.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week – that's what we think of the writer.  ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
