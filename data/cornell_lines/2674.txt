Well, what's the topic of discussion?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Understandable.  Lime?
No, really. I'm okay.
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
