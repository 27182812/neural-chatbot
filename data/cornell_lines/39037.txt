Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
A massive cardiac arrest.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
No.
What induced it?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Then how did it get into his body?
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
