Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
By who?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
