Laura, do you love me?
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
Why? It does.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
It does matter. We're in love.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
