All right, dear.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
The five hundred? Sure.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.

Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
