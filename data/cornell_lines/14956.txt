Jake, is that you?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
Where are you?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
I moved the couch. That's all.
Where to?
