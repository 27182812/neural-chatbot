I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
No.
Not at all?
You know how your Daddy is.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Soon.
