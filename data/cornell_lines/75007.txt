Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Huh?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Has he?
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
