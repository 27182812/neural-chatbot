Hi.  I saw you before.
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
See?
"Life is crushing in on me."
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where what was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Who lives?
See, I'm new.
Won't mother be proud.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
