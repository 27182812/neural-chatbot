Another one?
How long has this been going on?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
What mission?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Let me die then.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You're my father.
And don't come back.
