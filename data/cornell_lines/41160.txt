Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello?
