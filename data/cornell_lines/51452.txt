That shirt, Mr. Boone.
It's new.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
