Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
They are... friends of Congress.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
