Oh, yes, George.
What does that mean?
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
What if you don't get caught?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would I do it?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
No.
Are you sure?
Yes.  I'm sure.
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
