Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
I know.  Get out here.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
