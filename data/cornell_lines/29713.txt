It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Remember those words.
