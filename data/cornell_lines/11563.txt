You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
It's just a name.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Does she know anything about this?
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
