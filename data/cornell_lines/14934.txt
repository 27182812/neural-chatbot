Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
She hates me, Louis.
You should go back to her.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I can't relax.
Wiggle your toes.
