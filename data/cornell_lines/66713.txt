What was <u>that</u>?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Maroon, right?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
