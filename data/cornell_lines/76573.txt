Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
But it is what I want.
To be killed in battle?
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
