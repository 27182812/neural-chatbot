Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
