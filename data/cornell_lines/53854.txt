Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
What is it?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
