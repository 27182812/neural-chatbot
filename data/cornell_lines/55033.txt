They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
