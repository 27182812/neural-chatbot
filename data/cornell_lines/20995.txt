You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
No.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Yeah.
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
