Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
How old are you?
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
