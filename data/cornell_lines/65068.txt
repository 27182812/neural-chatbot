I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
Points very straight to her.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
What does he see?
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Very ridiculous.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
They call me Jeff.
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
Time's up.  I'm off the case.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
Because you think your in love with me?
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
