You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
I hear good things about the new play.

Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is it true?
Is what true?
He wears a disguise.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
But you're his friend.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
