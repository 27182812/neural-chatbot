You always been rich?
No.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
