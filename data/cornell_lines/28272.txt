You have to go.  I mean it.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Tonight.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
He has his uses too.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Maybe.
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
