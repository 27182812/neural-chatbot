Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
