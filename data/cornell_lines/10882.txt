He must be very nice.
Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
That.
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Dictation.  You know...
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Reducing?
No -- why? -- should I?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Very little.
Too bad.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Aren't you?
What?
Free --
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance --
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
Really?
