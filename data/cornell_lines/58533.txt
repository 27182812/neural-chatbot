Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
And he didn't have them?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Is that all?
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
And you believed him?
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
