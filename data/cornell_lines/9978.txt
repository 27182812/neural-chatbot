I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
What is it now?
Are you still looking for a job?
I guess.
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
