Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.

I know who it is.

Mel Gordon.

From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
