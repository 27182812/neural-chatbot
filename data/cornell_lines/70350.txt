Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
