I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
What sort of danger?
