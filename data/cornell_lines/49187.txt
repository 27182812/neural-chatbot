From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
... no, no, no...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Why are you doing this?!
I'm doing this for us.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
I swear on my life, I won't...
You will.  You know you will.
