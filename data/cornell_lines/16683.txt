Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Lili... I love you!
And I love you, my husband.
