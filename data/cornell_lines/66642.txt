Fifty years, huh.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
...What?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Ya got a good mind for dates.
