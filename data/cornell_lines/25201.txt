Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Gary.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
My condolences.
What are you pouring tonight?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
