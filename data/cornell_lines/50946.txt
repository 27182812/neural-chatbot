Where's home?
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
No, I'm not.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
Yeah... I guess it does.
