You don't count Saturday.
I'm not.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
Yest...
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
