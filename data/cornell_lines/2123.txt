Miss Price.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?

Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
