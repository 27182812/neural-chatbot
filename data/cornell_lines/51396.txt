Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
