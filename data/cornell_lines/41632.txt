Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Peter Joshua.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.
Good for you.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Please, not on my account.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
I'm not sure I --
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Oh. I guess.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Is your husband with you?
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Now you're angry.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Shakespeare never said that.
How do you know?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Are you in the book?
Charles is.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
