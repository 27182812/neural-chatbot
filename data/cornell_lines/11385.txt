Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
People don't use that word any more.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
