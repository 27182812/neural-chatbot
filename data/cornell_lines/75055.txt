Don't you work with Ian?
Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Yeah?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
No kidding.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
