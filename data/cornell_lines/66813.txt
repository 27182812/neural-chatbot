Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
