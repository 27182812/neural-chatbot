After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him.
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Then why did you come here?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
