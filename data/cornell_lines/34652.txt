Oh.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Well, hi!
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
No, no, no, not at all.
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
