You have the cutest nose I've—
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
It isn't cheap. It's nice.

Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
