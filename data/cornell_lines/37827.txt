No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
