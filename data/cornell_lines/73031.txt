General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Naturally I am, sir.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
