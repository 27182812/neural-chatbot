Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
How are we going to get them all up there?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
In about fifteen minutes.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
