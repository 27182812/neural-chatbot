It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.

You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.

The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
