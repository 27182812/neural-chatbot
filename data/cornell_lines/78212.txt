Q! How are you?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
