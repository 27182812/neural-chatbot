How many to a cell?
Four in this block, sir.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
