Hello.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
The two might go together.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Cute.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
