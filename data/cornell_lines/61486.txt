What?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.

Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
Like the fractals?
