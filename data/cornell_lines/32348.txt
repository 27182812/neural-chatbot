Santos... What's happenin' here?
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Where we goin'?
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
