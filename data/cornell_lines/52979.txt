Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Was I?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Why not?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
I don't know.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
But, you got four children!
I want one with you.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
