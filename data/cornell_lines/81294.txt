You look a little old for a student.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
She never mentioned her father.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
