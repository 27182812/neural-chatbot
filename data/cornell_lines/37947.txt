I want to work, Miss Lady.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Well, what can you do?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Extra?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
No..No that won't do...
