I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
Yes.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Yes.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
