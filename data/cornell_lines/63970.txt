Quite a mess.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Who?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
