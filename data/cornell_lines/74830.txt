Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
I'm just like him.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Did you worry about him?
Nobody worried about your father.
