Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.
What?
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Then what was it?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Something was there.  You saw it.
Did I?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Hartford?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
But Claire--
Please.
