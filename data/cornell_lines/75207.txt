I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I'll go down and speak to him.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
