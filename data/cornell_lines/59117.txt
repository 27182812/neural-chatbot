What is it, mother?
I wish to discuss your brother.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
