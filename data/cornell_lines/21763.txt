I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Yes... maybe it was.
