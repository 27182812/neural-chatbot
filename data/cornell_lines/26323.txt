I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
But that's what happened before.
Not this time.
