That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
The tenth's out.
What?
I can't make the tenth.
What do you mean?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Be reasonable, Jack.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
