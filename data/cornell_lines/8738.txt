Brother and sister still?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
Only you.
I will be here when you return.
