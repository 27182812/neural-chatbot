That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
