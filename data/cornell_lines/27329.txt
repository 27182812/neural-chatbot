Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
Surely you can be more specific...
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
What are the variables...?
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
You've programmed that from memory...?
I have.
