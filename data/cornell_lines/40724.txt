You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Why, somebody's complaining?
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
All right.
