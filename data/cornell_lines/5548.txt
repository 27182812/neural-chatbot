My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
No. He did not.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Humbly, M'lord.
