Genesis, I want it.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
