And the point is?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
What?!?!
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Trick him.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You should think about getting professional help.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
