Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Oh, fine.
Not on your feet too much?
No, no.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Was it reasonable?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
