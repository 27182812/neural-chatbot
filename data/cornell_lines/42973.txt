But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
I'm...what?  Sorry?

Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
