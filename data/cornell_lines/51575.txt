Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
No.  I expect you can't.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
One likes to live simply.
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
