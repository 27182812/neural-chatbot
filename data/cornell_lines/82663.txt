Jon, I do not want to hear it.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
You're the only human being I care for.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
I won't do that.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
