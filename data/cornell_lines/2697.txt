So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
And?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.
