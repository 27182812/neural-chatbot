Valentin Zukovsky.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
You, of course. I need some information.
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat’s nest.
Have some of the rat’s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
