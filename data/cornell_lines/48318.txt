What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Don't count on it.
