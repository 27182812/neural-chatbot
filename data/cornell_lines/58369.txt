Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
That was the night he disappeared?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
And when my father was Sheriff?
What about it?
What was your deal with him?
