He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
No, you don't!
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
I want the truth.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
...you heard echoes.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
