He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
What was the weapon?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Routine.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Do you remember his name?
Nope, can't say that I do.
Nilsen?
That's him.
