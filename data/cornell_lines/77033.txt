Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Yes, she would.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
What would your mother say to that?
This is my wedding.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
If you think it'll be all right.
