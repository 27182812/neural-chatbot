Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Thank you!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Disappointed?
No--proud. Very proud!
