Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
That's the way it is.
An' you say no cops?
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
You got dances too?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Say, who runs this place?
Government.
Why ain't they more like it?
*You* find out, I can't.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
That cut you got?
Crate fell on me.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
