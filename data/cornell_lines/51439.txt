You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
But I didn't do this!
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
We have his note.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
