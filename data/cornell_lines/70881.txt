That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Tomorrow night?
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
You're not?
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
I knew you would.
