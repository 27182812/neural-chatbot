What?
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
I won?
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
