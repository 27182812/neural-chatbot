How much more?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
You have other information?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
