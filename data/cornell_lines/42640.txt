I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.

I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I beg your pardon!
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
I hope it feels good.
You hope what feels good?
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
