You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
You're serious.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
