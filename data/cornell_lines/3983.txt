You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
What's your name, Giant?
Karl.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
You don't like it?
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
