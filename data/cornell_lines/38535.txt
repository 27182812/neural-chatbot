Finally got her back to sleep.
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--I know!
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
