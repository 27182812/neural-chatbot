I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
Then why didn't you help him?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
But Keaton...
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
