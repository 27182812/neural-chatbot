You followed me. I can't believe it!
I didn't follow you!
You followed me!
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!

Following is different. I was spying.

Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.

Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
