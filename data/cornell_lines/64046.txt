It's a little late for me.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
The fish?
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
The next time I walk into a bank.
