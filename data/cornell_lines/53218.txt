In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
She my foster.
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
No.
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
We got KittyKat...
Yes.... yes...
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
...who say...?
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
