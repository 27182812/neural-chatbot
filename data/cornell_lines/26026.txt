Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
You.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
