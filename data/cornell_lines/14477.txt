I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
