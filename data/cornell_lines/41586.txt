I think Tex did it.
Why?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
What's so illogical about that?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
Who?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
What -- like Scobie?
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
