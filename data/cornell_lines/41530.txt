I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.

What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
