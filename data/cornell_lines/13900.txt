What's Gruner like?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Who was?
Ryuji and Gruner.
And Dieter.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
And you?
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
