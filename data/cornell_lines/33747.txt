... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
The show must go on.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
They'll do as they're told.
