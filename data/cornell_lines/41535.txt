Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Agent.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
May I have a sandwich, please?
