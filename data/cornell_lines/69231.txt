As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
