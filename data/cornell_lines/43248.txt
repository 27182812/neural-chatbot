Ellie, what is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I can't do this --
What are you so afraid of?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Please --
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
-- I don't know --
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
I can't hear this now --
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
