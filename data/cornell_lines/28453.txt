Why did you go to Chicago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
I was looking for a pattern.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
