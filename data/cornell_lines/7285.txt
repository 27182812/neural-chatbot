How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
