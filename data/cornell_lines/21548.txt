Buddy? ...
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
I don't want them to love me.
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
