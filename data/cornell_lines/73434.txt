Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
I'll make it short.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
What has Artie to do with it.
We're engaged.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
It's just impossible.
Nobody can be that busy.
