Hello, Don.
Hello. Wendy.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
