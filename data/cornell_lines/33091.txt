I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
You're what?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For the Church?
For Agnes.
You think she's a saint?
She's been touched by God, yes.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
The father!
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
How  ?
Don't be ridiculous.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
This is insane.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
You're saying God did it?
