Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I think so.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Sometimes you do.
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
