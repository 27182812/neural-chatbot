Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.

I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
And neither will I.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
