We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Why?
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
