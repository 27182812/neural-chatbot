Kids.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
What happened?
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Jesus!
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
I guess.
Like I said; you really can't blame the boy.  Some people don't know how to avoid trouble.  Know what I mean?
