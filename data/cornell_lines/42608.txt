You had to tell him.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
What did he say?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
What time do you get finished?
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Sure.
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
