Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
What about Billy?
I'm not taking him with me.
What?
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
