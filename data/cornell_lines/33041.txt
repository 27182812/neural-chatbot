Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
