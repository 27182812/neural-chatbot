I miss Murray, Harry.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
