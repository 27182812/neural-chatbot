Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Why not?
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
