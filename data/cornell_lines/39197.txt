You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Please -- not now.
Why didn't you come to me?
I don't know.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It's more involved than that.
It was a place to start.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
