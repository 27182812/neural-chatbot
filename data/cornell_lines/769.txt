She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I would like to have died in peace...
