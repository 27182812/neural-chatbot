What? What? What now?
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
The door was open, I got a call --
You're just come in --
Calm down.
I am calm.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
There's no disturbance.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
There's no disturbance.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
I AM CALM.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
I don't have to answer your questions.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
What does it look like?
No one else in here?
You're here.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
No.  I said that.
Are you lyin' to me?
I live alone.
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
No I Said.
Ok. What's your name?
Marcie.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
I preffer to stand.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
