How long has my father been like this?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
So what's up with you?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
