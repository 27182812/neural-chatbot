The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
What's that?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
So?
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
