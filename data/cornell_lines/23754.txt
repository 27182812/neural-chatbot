It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
I'll bet it's been done.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
You think I made all this up?
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
For instance?
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
All right -- you don't believe me.
