I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
