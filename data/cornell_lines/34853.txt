Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Look around, sweetheart.
