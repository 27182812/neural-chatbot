How many times do you want to hear this?
Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
I know what it sounds like.
You don't know shit!
I didn't kill her!
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About what?
About Jessica.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
-- Bad?!
