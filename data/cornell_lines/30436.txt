Now what?
Now what what?
Whaddo we do?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
