How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Don't go out of your way.
