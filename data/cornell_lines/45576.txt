Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
They're okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
