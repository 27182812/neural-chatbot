What?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It couldn't have been.
It was him.  I'm positive.
It's impossible!
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
