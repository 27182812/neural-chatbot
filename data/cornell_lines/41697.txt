What do you mean?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
A little.
How much further?
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Not much further.
You never went, uh, all the way?
