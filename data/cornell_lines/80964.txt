Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
My name is Ronald Brean.
Who're you working for?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
What <u>are</u> you interested in?
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
