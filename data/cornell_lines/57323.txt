I can't follow you.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
