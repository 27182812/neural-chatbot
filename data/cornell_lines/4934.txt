Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Why not?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah, but.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
OK.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, yeah, call.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Yeah.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Are you sure?
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
