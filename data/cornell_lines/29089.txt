Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Yes I am.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Why, thank you Travis.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
