What is it now?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Sea bass.
Right.
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
