I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
You told Ann about this?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Why not?
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
Hung up.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
No.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
It won't. I trust him.
You trust him.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
What do you mean?
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
How about straightening up the living room?
