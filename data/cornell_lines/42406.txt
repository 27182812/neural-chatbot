There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
What?
I've got to think of Emily -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
Go ahead.
