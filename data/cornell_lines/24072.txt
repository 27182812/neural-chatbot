Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
