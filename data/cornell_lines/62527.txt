James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
Where's Wilma?
She done moved to Detroit.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
I been sendin' her money.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Like where?
I don't know. He's your boy.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
