No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
