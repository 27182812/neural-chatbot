Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
Me too.
You're not... seeing anybody?
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
I have?
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
