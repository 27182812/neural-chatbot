Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
For what?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Apology acknowledged.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Um. You.
There you go with those moves again.
Too aggressive?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
I'm special.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
