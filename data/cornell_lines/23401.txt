They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
Just tell him to call me.
Ok.
So...did my brother call you?
No.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
It's fine.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
He did seem a little strange.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Ok.
