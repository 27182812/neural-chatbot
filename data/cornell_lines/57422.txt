Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
Yes.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
No.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
No.
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
No.
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
No.
Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
