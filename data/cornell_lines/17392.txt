They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
