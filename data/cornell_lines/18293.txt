I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Let some of us come down there.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
