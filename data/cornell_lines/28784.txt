Was there a definite proposal?
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
We should hear what they have to say.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
And when they shot me father...
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
