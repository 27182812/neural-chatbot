Did he give you anything?
No.
Anything at all?
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
Not that I could see.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
