Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
