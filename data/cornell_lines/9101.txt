Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
"Dad."
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Should I be afraid?
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
