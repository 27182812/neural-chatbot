Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
