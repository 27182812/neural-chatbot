Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
