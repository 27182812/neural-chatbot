I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
So pay them back and apologize.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
