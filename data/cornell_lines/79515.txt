Thank you, John.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I just drove in this morning.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Least you can leave.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
