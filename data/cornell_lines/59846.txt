I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
Stripper?
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Hostess?
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Chinese food?
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Bye.
