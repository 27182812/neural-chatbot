Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
-- We must do something...
Yes, the police must be called.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Yes, I know them --
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
We must call the police, your excellency.
