Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
I know Denver.
You sure?
I know what I see.
Might see anything at all at 124.
True.
Better ask Paul D.
Can't locate him.
He's sleeping in the church.
The church!
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
He ask, I give him anything.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I don't know him that well.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
It's her, ain't it?
Her who?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
