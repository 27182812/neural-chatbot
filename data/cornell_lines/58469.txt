So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
I told you --
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
No.
You said you weren't with him for love.
I wasn't.
What then?
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
