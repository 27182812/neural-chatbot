Professor Waldman.
Victor, explain yourself.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
