I don't know you.
Ahhh, but I know you.
How?
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
When?
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
I didn't break that window!
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
What are you? A policeman?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
I think you're a louse.
I am.  Good day.  Madam.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
