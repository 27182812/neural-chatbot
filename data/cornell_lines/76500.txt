Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?

You seem very sure about that.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
What is?
Dying without ever reaching the top...
