I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
How do you know I'm innocent?
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
They're dead, John.
