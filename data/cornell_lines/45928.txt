Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
I'm fine.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
