So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
You hitched yet?
No sir...
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
