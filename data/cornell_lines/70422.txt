And what's the occasion of this celebration?
It's my birthday.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Actually, I'm his father.
