Where are you going?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
