Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Where?
At the Houmfort.
That's nonsense, Alma.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
