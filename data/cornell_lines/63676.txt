Hi-iii...
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
Why?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
A little bad luck?
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
