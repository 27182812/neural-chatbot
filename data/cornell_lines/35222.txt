Why did you come to ... my province.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
You were not coming here, to see me?
No -- no, sir.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
What do you mean, Colonel?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
You know you're right.
