I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Yes.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
It's not important.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Why, you need me for the story?
No.  Were you going to you?
Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
We can go together.
