Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
I'm not.
Did you make me a tape?
I already made you two tapes.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Send me a kiss.
