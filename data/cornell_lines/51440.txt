Good morning.
Mornin'.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Nice place.
And your name is --?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Just that I was in the Marines.
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
