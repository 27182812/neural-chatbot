When's the latest time you were out there?
Seventy... eight.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
What's tira misu?
You'll find out.
What is it?
You'll see.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
You'll like it.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
