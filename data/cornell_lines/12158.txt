Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Sure.  Ten cents.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
