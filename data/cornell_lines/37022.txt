I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
How about dangerous curves?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
I've got to stop him.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
