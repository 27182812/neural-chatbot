Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
What are you doing up here?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
