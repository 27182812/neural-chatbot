Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
What do you mean by "seen?"
Looked at with your eyes.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
