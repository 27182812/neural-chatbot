You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
