It buys things, just like any other kind.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
No.  I paid him off.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
You-killed-him?
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
So that I will never be found.
