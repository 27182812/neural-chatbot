...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
You're kidding me.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
Jesus...
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Did better'n that.
