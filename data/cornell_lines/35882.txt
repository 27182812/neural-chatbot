No, just a drill.
A drill, what are you up to?
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Yeah.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
