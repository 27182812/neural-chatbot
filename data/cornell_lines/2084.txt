Could you get here without any trouble?
Yes, I should think so.
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
Yes, Doctor.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
