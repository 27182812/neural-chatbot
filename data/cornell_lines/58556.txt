What about you? Why are you here?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Try twenty-five.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I'm thinking about it.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
Oh.
What do you do?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
What did you study?
Philosophy.
Oh, what do you do with that?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Thanks.
