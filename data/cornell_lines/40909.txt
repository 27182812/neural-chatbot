He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Okay.
All right?
Yeah.  Thanks.
