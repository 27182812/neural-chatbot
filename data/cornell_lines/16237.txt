Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
You can change.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Don't be so sure.
