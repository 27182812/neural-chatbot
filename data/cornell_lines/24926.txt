Hi!
Ann. Hello.
Are you in the middle of something?
Nothing I can't finish later.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
