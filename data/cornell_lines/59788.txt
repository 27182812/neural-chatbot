Hey, come on...
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
And say what?
I'll say that I'm travelling.
