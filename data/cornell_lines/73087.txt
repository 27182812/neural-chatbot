What do you mean?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
You tell me.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Why should they call us back?
How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.
