George.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I already said hello.
Okay.
George.
Yeah, baby.
When can I talk to you?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
About what?
Whether or not I'm going.
Going where?
Egypt.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
No, but I think they might.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
