Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
How're the tips?
A dollar forty.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Not a chance.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
