What is your name?
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Shut up!
OK. Say what it is.
The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
