...It's kind of a pro bono job.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
I would.
