There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
And who might that be?
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
