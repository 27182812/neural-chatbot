Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
