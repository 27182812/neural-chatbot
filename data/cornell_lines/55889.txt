Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
What for?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
