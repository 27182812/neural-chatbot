Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
