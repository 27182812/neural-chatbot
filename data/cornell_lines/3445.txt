OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
