Yes?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
Let me speak to my daughter.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Please... wait.
The game's over.  You lost.
It's me you want.  Not her.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
