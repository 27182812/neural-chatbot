So how was it? What was he doing?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
