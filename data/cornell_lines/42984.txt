Limos, huh?
Don't start.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Yeah?  What happened?
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
What happened?
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
It's not bullshit.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
