What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Fixing it.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
The refridgerator.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
That wasn't in there before.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
None of this was here before.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
You think?
You don't believe me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
