What's the plan.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
This is not my usual Friday night!
