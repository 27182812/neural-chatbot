Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
My dreams died long ago.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
