STOP IT!
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No one's asking you to!
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
WHY?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
