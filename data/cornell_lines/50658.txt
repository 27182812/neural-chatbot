Do you think he can do it?
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
Home.
Someone waiting for you?
No one's waiting.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Yes.
Never mind.
