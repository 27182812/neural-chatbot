You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Thank you.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
