Oh, my God!
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
