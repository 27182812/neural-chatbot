I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Sure.
Am I right?
I can see that. Sure.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Mm, you want to steal it?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
I know what you mean.
