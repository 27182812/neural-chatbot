I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
What?
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
It's circumstantial.
