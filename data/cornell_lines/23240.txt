Don't get upset.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Where are you going ...
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
COME BACK!!!
