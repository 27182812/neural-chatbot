Well, the reward still stands...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Told ya, didn't I?
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
