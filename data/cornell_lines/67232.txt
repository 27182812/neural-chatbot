Where are you going?
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
It's my job!
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
I have plenty of dates.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
And you ain't black!
