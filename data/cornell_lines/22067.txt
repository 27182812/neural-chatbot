What did you call me?
Pardon?
What did you call me, boy?
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
I didn't call you anything before that.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
No, sir.
Where are you from, boy?
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
No, sir.
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
