But being out of the game gives me time to write.
To what?
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
What?
The "crises"?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Whatcha mean by that?
You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
