You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
