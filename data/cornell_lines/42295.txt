Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Who else you been to see?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
You know why?  She was so -
Sure, sure.
I'm going back there.
Who else did you see?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
He made an awful lot of money.
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
