Hello.
Hello miss.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
