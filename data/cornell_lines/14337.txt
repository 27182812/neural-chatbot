That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
