Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job!
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
But I don't have it.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
