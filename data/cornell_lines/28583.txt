Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
I didn't want to say anything.
Why?
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Kinda.
I don't talk about her that much.
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
