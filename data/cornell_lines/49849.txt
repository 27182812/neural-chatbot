LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Where am I going?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
They serve dinner on the flight?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
You sure those doors will be open?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
That's right.
You sure got the hard part.
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
