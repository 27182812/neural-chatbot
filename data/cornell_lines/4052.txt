Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Of course.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
