What the hell is the matter with you?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes.
I wrote it.
What?
Yes, I wrote it.
You wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.
What was there to tell?
My God, what do you think?
Do you know what you're saying?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
I know.
How do you know?
