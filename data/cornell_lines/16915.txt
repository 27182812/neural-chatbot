Is your back still killing you?
I didn't think you'd come today.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
No.  Mostly me.
Peter left me yesterday.
Left you?
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
What did he say?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
