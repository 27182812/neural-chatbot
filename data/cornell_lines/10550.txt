I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Who was the architect?
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
