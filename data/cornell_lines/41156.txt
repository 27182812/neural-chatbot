Lady, try making some sense.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
Who smashed the phone?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
I don't believe you.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
My name is --
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
You won't disconnect.
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
Then hang up!  Do it!
