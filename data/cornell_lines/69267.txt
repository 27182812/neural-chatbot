I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
You cannot marry Wessex!
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
