I want to give you an Oscar.
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Yeah.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Your brother? What you talking about?
