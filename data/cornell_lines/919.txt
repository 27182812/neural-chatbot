Do it.
Don't think I won't.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
