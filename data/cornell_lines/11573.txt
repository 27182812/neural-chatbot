Just do what I say. Don't ask.
What is going on?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
What plan?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
