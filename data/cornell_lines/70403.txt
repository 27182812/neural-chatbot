Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Okay.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
