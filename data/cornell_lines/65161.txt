Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
I don't know, sir.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
