Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
