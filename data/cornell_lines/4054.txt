Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
