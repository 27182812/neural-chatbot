I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I ought to call the police right now!
No.
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
She haven't even called you?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
You've led a charmed life.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Maybe we can handle it together.
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
You want me to stay here?
She'll need both of us.
Where... can I stay?
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
