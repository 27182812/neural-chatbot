Maybe tonight?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Sonofabitch.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
I wasn't asking.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
Nineteen.
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
