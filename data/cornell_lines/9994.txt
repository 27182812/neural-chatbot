Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Uh-oh.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
