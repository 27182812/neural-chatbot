These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
As you wish.
