Whoa. What was that?
What?
Your mom made a move on me.
She did not.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Will not.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Shut up!
I will stop this car right now.
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Kids.
