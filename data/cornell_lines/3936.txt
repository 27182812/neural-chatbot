See! The big guy likes it.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Yes!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
