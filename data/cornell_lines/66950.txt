Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I do.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
There is that.
