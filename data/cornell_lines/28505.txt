It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
Zero killed them all?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
