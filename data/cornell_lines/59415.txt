Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Was I in an accident?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
