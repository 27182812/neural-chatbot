This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.

He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
