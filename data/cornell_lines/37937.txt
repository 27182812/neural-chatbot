You don't sit with me!!
Baby, don't be like that.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
