And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Will you call me?
I don't have your number.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
You do, huh.
