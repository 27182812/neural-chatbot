So what is it you want to know?
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Created?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
You seem one to me.
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
