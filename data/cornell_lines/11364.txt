How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
