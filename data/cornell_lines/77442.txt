I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
You don't know.  You don't....
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
