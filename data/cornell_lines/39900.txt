I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Maybe I should come up with you.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
