How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
