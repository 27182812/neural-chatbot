What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
What?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
