Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Sir?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
You're going to take her off my hands?
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
You left your wife?
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Yeah --
Now what was your news, Baxter?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
