Was the paralysis immediate?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Nearly a year.
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
