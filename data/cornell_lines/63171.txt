Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Well done you.
