No -- you can't do that.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
I don't know.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
Not that we know of.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
