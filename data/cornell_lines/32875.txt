Used to what?
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
But how could you say such a thing?
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
You already know what they are.
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
