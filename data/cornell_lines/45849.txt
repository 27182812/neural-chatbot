Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
C'mon, Sal.
Where we goin'?
