We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You know that's not true.
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
