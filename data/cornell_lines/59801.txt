You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
There won't be any this week.
What do you mean?
Didn't show up.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I don't like loading crates.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
