Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
It's a long story.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
No.  It was my singing.
Excuse me?
She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
