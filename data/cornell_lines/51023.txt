I mean, what for?
That's what I was wondering.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Why would it?
It just would. He was always the same.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.
Nobody seems to know.
