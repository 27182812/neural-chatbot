Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Looking for me?
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
You was a Golden Warrior.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
