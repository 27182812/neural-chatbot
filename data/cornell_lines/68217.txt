Okay, what did we just decide?
We decided...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No, no.
It sounded like you did.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
No, I don't, I don't.
Yeah you do.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
You shared it with a dick.
No I didn't.
Is this because of your dad?
No.
Did you talk to Corey?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.
You told your dad?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Then don't do it.
Oh shit.
