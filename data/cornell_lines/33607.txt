Hungry?
Just some coffee.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
