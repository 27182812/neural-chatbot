Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
You're not listening to me.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
