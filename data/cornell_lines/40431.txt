Not a pressing issue.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Uh... gym.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Sporting events, yeah.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Okay.
