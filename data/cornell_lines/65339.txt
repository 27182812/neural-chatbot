What do you want?
Shrimp and fries.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
I need you to teach me.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I'm serious.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
