What's happened??
The documents are forged.
No!
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
It can't be true!
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Italian is practically the same thing.
