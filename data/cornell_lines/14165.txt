It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
Why do you think she did it?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
