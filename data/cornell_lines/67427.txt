Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
And what did you say?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one!  Thanks.
It happens to be how I feel.
