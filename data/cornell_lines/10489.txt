Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Has this ever happened before?
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
