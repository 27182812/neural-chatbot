Thelma!
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
