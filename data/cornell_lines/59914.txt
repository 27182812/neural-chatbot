What is this?
Annie made them.
Who's Annie?
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
I don't like cake.
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
'Goddam party'!
