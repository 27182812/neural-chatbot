Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
People still need values, beliefs....
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
You will.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
