Brian. What's wrong?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
I was doing my job.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Leave Stephen out of this --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
-- I work for the city.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
