Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
Twisted?
You know what?
What?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Basic.  Hmmm.
So what's your job this summer?
Job?  Being a great date.
No, I'm serious.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.
Then call me later.
