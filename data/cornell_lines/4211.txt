I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
What do you want?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
