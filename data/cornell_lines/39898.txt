It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
How long you been doing this?
Five years.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I think I'd remember that.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Sure.
