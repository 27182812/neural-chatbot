Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
What the fuck is going on?
