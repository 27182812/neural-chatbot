Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
