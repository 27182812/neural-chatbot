I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
I haven't been out here for a while.
You go by your old house?
No.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
