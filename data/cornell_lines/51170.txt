What are we going to say?
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I'm not sure I have two.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
Alright.
Good.  Now we're talking.
