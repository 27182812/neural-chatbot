I'm going to the dance.
What for?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
He did what he was supposed to.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
I should have known.
