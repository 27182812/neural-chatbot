Been trying to figure out your secret.
My secret?
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
...like a fish.
No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout...
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...the master of his realm.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
Tie a fly...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...back...
...and that power...
...without caution...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...-to a simple thing like...
...fishin'.
Some people might.
