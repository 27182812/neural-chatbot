It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
You don't really think so?
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
