Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Very funny.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
