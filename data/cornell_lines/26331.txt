Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
You should have told me.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Thank you.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Neither did I.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
Chris --
I can't stay here.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Then you won't make it.
