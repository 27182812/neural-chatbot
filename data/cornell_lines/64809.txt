Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
It's probably wrong --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
The evidence was very meager --

That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
