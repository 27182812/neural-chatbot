So how is she?
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
