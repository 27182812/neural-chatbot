Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
