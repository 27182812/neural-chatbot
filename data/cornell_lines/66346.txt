I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
You know what I mean.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
