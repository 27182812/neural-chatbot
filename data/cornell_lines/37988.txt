I know my rights.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Uh-huh.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
