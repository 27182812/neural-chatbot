Mr....Kay?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
You didn't?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
My monsters?
Don't go away.
