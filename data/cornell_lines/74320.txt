Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
