What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
I know that.
But even if you were in love with me.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Sometimes.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
Goodbye, Betty.
