Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
And who the hell is that?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Can you fake the cerebral output?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
