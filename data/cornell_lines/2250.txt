Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
Cyril!
