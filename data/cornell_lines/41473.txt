She can't help it.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
You liked her?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Don't know her.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
If they kill me --
Don't think that way.
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
