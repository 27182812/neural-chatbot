Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
