Are you with the tournament?
Uh huh.
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
When I was very young.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
