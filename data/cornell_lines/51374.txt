It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
There are still things I have to do.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
No, I meant lose his family.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
But times are different...
