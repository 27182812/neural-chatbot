Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
