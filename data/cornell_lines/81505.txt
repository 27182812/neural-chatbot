My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
And whose houses do you design...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
You still feel that crazy...?
