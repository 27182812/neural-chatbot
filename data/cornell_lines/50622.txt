You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
