I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
What?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I want to be alone.
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it.
