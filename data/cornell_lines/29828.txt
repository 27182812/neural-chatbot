I'm really sorry, Max.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
He doesn't walk all over me.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
