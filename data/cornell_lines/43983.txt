The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
So what will you do now?
