No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
