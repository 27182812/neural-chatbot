You got your DP?
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
