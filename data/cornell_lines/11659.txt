I like Glaucus.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Well, I really don't smoke.
It's all right.  It's organic.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Did Confucius say that?
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
You are the wisest person I know.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
What was that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Of course.
Okay.
