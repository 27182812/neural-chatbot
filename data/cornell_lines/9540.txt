Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
