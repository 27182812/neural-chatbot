You going to wait here for me?
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I believe it.
