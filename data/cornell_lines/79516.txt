Where you coming from?
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens if you lose?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
