Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.
How far?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Fancy it?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
Bloke told me.
