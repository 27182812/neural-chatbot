Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Oh, thank you.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
Of course, of course...
So...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
It certainly is.
