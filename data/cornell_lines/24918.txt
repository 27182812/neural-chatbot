Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.
