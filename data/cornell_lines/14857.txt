Louis?
What?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Came outta where?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Then what?
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
That's right.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Fuck you for asking me that.
Pull the car over.
