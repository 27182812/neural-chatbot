Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
