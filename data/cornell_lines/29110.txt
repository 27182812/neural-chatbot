Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Neither do I, I guess.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Thanks.
