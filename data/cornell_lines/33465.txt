I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
