Yeah.
Do you recognize my voice?
I think so.  Detective squad?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Is he alive?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming.
