Sit down.
Where's Kuato?
On his way.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Yeah.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
What, aliens?
You tell me.
I don't know.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
You're Kuato, right?
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
