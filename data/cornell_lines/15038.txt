It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I don't know what to do.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
What do you mean?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
You've seen them?
Everywhere, like a plague.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
Oh God. I know. I know.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
The army?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
I don't know. I don't know.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
