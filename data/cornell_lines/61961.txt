Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Kinda like men.

You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
