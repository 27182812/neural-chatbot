And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
It's a novel.
About me!
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
What are you saying?
Hello?  Last birthday was?
I don't look my age, Joe.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
