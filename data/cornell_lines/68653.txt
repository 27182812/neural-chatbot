I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Sure...
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I'm getting scared.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I believe you...
So you better leave.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
