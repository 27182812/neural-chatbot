There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
