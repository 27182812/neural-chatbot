What an interface!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
