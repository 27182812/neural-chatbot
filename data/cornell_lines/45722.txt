Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
That's the rumor on the street.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. <b> INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY </b>
