Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Strange.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
I wasn't about to.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
I might say the same.
