Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Not a clue.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
I don't follow you.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
So what?
