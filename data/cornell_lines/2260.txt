Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
