Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
He gave it to me.
I don't understand.
Where were you the day he died?
At a horse show.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Did you kill my father?!
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
