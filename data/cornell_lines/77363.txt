Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
A headache?
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
Okay.
