Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
We were all upset about that.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
C'mon, I see what I can do.
