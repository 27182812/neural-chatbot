Here, don't panic.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Mr. Bialystock ...
