Oh, there you are--
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Never mind.
