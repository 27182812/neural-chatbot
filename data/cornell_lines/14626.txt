Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?

The assassination, Jack?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say.

What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.

You're so naive, mister.
