You don't like coming here, do you?
It's okay.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Honest? No.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Forget it.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
I don't need someone else.
