I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Thank you, Norman.
Norman.
You're not going to... to your room already?
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Phoenix?
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
I'd like to, but...
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Very early. Dawn.
Alright, Miss...
Crane.
That's it.
Good night.
