Sorry, didn't mean to --
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I think you look beautiful.
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
