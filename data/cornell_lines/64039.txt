Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
How many?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Okay.  How many going out?
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
