What'd you guys find?
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
And the other car?
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
