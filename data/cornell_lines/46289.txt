Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
