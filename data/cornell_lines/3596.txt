A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
