You <u>swore</u>!
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
I know.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
I see her for business.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
