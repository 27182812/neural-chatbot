Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
I got them all, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
That's a chance we have to take.
Maybe we ought to leave.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
When?
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Where will we go?
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
What happens when we run out of wood?
