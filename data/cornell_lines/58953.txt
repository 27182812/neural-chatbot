Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
So you've done it --
Well I don't go out very much.
Why not?
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
No, no.
You wanna make a deal with me?
ok.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
...yeah...
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
Let's make a deal.
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
