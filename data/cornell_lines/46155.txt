You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
We call that one Muad'dib.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
