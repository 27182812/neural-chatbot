How'd you get this number?
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
That's my dad.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
How do we do that?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
