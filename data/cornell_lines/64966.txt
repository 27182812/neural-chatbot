Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!
