. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Yes, sir.
How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Money.
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
A hundred dollars!
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
