Thelma, if I die--
What?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him.  I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you.  You're a good mother.
