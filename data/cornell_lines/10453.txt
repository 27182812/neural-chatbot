Oh, Dana, it's you.
Hi, Louis.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
I got the Twister game for later ...
