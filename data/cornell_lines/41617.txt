One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
A letter? May I see it?
