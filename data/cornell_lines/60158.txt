Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --

Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
So what's wrong with that?
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
You're not listening --
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
