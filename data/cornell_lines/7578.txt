Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
