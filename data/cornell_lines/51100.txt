How many leads have we got?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Yes.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
