I think I know...
Something most important you can do.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
