Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
So, what's the news?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
