I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
But your man isn't quite a God!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
