I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
No.
What do you mean, no?
We're not going anywhere.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
