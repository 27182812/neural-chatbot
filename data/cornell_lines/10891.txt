Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
