You excited?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Why you think is today?
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
