I'm fine.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, just enjoying the view.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
