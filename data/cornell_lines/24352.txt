Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
But you eat, don't you?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Where do you keep the can opener?
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
