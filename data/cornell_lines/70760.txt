Oh - Sugar!
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
If there's anything I can do for you -
Oh, I can think of a million things -
