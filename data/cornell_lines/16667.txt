It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.

The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
