Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
