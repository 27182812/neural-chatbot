Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
That's right.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
What position did you occupy?
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
