How 'bout you, Jerry.
How are you, Bill?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Can I see him?
Sure.
