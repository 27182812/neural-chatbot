Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
You what?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Sid, there's no baby.
What?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
