Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
How much?
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
