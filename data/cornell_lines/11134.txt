A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
Uh-huh.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Never.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
