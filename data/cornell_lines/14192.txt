Hello?
Miles?
Yes? Marylin?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Marylin? When did I say...?
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
