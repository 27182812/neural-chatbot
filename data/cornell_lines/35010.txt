I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Well -- I guess so.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
