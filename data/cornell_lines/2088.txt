Mr. Kessler?
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
How is that?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Sorry.
