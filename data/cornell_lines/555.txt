Pay money?
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
