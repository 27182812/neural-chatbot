I don't believe it!
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
