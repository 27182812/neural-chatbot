Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
