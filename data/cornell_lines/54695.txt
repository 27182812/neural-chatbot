Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Could you believe that crazy elephant?
