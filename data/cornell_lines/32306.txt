That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
They have, sugar.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
It's a comfortin' idea.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
There's worse places, honey.
If you say so.
Trust me on it.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
What's that?
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
