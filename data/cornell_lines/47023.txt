You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Who are his ghosts?
Ask him.
What if I told you he did this to me?
What?  How could he have?  When?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
I don't know what that means.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Please don't creep around this house.
