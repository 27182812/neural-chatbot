Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
I... I don't believe this.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
You should watch what you say.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I was decorated.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Exactly.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
You can't testify.
Why not?
