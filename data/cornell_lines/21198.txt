Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
