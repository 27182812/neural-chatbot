Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
