Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
So?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
