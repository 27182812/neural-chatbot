Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
What do you mean if we should get out?
Did I say "if"?
That's what you said.
Well - I mean—
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Uh-huh.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
