Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
No.
Why not?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
You look all right now.
I am all right.
