Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
