All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
You're not happy with your part.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Huh, fine.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Hello.
Who's this?
Who's this?
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
But you know my favorite name?
I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
Roman that's not the line.
It is in my script.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
What?  What movie?
My movie.
