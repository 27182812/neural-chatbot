Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
We didn't have sex.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
