Can I help you with something?
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
