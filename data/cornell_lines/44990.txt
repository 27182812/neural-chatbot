None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
What is that supposed to mean?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Er  No.
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
No.
