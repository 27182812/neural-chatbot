Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
What's wrong?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Where did it come from?
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
