You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
I am a fool.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Not if it clears the air.
It does.  May I go now?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
I don't understand.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Now, you're being beastly.
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
And if you didn't believe me?
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
