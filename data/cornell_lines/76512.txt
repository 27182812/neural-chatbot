A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
Should I be?
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
Can I get up now?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
You-you’re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I’m in London. That’s all.
