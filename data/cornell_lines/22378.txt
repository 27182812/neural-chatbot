It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
You don't look alright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Yeah.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
