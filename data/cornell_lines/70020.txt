You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Useless distractions.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
What's wrong with my life?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
