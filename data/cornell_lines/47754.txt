Where do I put ashore?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
Not you?
No.
Good.
