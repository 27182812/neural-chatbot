Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Gittes, stay outta this.
