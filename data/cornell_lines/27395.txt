Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
I am well, Admiral.
You will be in good hands here.
