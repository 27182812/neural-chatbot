I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
