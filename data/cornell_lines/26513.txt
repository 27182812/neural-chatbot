Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Just call me Spidey.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Thanks, I already ate.
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Well...
