This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Go away.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Leave me alone!
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Oh ... Jesus!
