Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Oh, OK.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
