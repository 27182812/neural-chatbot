Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
When was this?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
