You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
<u>Why</u>??
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Well - you'd need a body.
