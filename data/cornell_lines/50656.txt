You've worked with Elliot?
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
There was a review.
I think I remember.
So does Elliot.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Oh. You know him.
A little.
And he has finer moments now and then.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Endearing.
Engaging.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
A little drastic maybe?
Say it again.
What?
You know what.
Alla puttanesca.
One more time.
