It's only a siren...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
And they frighten you?
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
