Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Jesus, Lenny.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
