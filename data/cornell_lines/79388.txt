Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
