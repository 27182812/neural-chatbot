Morning, Hollis.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
You thought any more about our murder?
We have a murder?
Charley Wade.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
I got an idea what happened.
Do you?
I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
