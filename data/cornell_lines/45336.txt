Howdy, Jabez.
Howdy, Hank.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
