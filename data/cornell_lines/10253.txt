They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
I'll be bait alone?

I'll have to.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Was that supposed to make me feel better?
