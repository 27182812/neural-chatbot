You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
She is an innocent.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
That's what I have to believe...
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
