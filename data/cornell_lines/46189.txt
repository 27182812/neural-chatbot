They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
The <u>women</u>?
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
I never thought of that.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
