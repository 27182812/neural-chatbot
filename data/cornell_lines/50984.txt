Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
What name?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Why?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Why?
I don't know. That's all I was told.
