Someone dead from this household?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
