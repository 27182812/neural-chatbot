Thanks, but no thanks.
Against your code?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
No.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
That's right.
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
