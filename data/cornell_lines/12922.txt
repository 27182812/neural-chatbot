I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
It's embarrassing, okay?
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
