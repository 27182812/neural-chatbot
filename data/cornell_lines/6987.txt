And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Yes.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I met a girl.
What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
Who is the boss?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
What about your family, Donnie?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
