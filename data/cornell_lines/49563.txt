I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Happily married, probably.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Sure...
