What's that?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
How long will the effect last?
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes...
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
