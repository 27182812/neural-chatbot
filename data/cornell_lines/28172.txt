You thought we were a different planet?!
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes?
Yes.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
The captain...
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
I don't understand 'friend.'
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
I understand.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What is hell?
It's bad.
He will.
