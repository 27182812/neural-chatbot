Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
