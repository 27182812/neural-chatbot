David! You're hurting my feelings.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I can't stand it.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
Life mocks me even in death.
