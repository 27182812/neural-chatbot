How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Thank you.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
I'd like to hear it.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
