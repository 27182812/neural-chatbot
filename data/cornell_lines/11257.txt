Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Why?  You interested?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
