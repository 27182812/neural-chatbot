Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
I didn't know that.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
They're all divorced?
Everybody's divorced.
It didn't used to be that way.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
