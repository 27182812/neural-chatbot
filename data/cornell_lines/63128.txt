So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
I'm an actress.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Well, they can be.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Films mainly.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
