Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
