I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
I know, but that's enough.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I know it, I know it.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
Take it easy, though.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll get a heart attack like that.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
