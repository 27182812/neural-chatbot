Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
V'asitem...
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
No difference.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
What's it about?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
And belief follows?
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Fuck that.
Don't curse in front of it.
Why should I submit?
You shouldn't.
You think I should just because there's no reason?
