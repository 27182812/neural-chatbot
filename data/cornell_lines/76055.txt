He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Have you known him long?
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
What was he like, when he was little?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
