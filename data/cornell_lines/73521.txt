All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
