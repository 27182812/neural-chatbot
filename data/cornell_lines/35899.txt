Why are there still such headlines?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
You are quite sure it's secure?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
