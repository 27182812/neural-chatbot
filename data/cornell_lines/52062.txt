How's it goin'?
Fine.
Want me to take a look?
No.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
It's important that I learn this.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Clearly.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.
