To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
