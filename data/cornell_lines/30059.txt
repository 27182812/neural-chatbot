I just love mechanical things.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
