Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I don't know.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
