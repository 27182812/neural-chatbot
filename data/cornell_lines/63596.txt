I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
There's no such thing.
What?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
