I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes.
How?
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
How?
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Who?
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
And you told Brumby?
