It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
Yes -- on the boat.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
Is she a doctor?
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
I like her already.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
Thank you.  But who sits there?
My brother's wife.
