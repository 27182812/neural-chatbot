I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
