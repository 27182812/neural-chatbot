Look at that sky.  It's so big.
It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Maude, do you pray?
Pray? No.  I communicate.
With God?
With Life.
