You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
Oh, is this your special place?
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
