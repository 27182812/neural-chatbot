Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
What's that?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
For getting a divorce?
Well... it is his third.
