You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
What about him?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
That so.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Who is Mickey?
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
Well, you can't win 'em all.
