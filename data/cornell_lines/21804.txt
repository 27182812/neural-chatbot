Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
The Five?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
