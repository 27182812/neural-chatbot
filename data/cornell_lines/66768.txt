What the hell are you doin'?
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
