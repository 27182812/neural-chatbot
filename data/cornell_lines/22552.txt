We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
I'm not climbing that.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
