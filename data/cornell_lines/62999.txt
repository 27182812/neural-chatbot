Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
yeah, I had a bad night.
You want to talk about it?
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
