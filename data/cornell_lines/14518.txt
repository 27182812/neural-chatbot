Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
