I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
Good night.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Why do you say that?
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
I went for a walk.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
