It has come to pass.
What?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.
You mean black people?
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
What's a concubine?
Check your driver's license.
