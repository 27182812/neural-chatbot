I don't suppose there's a drink left...
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
Why not?
Because I don't want to.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
You're being childish.
