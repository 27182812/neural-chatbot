I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Stop it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
