Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
I drink.
How does it affect you?
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
And what if amateurs try it?
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
