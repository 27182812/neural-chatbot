This is the baby sitter.
Oh. When are they expected home?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
He has it. Thank you.
Goodnight.
