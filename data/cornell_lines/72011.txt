Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Sir, no, sir.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
