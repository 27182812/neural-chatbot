No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
