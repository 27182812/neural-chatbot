...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
What?
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
