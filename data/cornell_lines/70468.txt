It's for you.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Open it.
What is this, some kind of joke?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
And why the hell would you give me money?
So I can get my job back.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
