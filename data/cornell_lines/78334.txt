No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Junior spends time with his child.
Oh here we go with that.
