Gee -- that Fair --
It hasn't opened yet?
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
Guess there will, if it says so.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Young man -- you got me there.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
And what about Daniel Webster?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
And serve him right!
