Stevens!
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
No, Stone!
-- in gold.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....
