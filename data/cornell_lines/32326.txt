Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
That was in Vietnam.
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
What?
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
