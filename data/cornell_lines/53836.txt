Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
And I can't help having a cold.
What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
