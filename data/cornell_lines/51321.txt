It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Within the compound will be fine.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
That's off now.
I'm going to see my parents.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
How long does this go on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
That's not the way we look at it.
