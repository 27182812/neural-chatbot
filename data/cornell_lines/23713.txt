What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.

I'm not interested in him.
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
