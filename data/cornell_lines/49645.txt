Robert...
Very nice.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Everybody still up on the Island?
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.

Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
