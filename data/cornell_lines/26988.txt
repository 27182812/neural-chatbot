Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Yours...?!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
