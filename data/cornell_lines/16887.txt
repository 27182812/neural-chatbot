What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I don't have a phone.
I drove over and you were gone.
I can't leave the house?
Last time you were gone for a week!
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
