Come on, Ma.
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break."
You know what your problem is?
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Me?! That's you!
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
