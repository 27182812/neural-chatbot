Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
What're you doing here?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Rough day on the set?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
...That's what we finally decided.
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
