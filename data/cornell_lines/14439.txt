Don't "Joe" me.
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
