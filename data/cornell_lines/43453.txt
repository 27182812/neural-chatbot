You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
