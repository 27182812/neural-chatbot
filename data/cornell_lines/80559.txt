Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Who else?
Charles Moore for instants.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
He's quiet.
He's weird.
