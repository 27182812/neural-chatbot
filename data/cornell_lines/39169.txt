I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
Why?
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
