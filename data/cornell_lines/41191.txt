Why didn't you just shoot them?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
You're going to let them get away with this?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
So far they're keeping their part of it.
They put their hands all over me.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
