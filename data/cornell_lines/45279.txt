You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
