Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Alive?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
You mean a figurehead.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
If you say, miss.  If you say.
