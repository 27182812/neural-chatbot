Where did this body go?
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Shit, we didn't sign in.
So get the hell out of here.
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in --
