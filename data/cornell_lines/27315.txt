Steady, now. We need your help.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.

We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
Kirk. They're gone.
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
... Damn!
