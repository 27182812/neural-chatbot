Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
A voice?
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
'Yes'.
'Yes' to the deal?
Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
