Can I help you?
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I don't play for no team.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
