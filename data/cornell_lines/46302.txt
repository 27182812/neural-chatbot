Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
You could say that --
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Raising money is tough.
Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
