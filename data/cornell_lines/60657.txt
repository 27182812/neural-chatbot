You feel anything?
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
