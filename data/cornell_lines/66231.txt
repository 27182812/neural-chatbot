What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
More history, Rose.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, I am working on my thesis.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
You're so sweet.
