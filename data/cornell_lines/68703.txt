Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Have you contacted the bureau?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
You think he could still be in town?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Yes, sir.
