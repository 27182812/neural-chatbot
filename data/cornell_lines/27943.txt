At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
An individual more like you, you mean.
Yes.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
