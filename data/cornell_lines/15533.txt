Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
