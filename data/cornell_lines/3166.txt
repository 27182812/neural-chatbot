Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
It looks awful.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
