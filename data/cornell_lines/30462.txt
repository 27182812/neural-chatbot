You awake?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Me too.  I feel awake.
Good.
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
