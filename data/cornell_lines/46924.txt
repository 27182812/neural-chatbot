Jerry--
Christ!
Ssh!
Bobby--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Bobby--
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Jesus.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Bobby--
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Jerry--
Listen to me.
You gotta--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
No, I--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
To the cops?
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
So do I!
