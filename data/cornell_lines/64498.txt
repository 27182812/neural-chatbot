ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
That's not what I said.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
No.
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Maybe you should think about it.
What's that mean?!
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm not going to die.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
I'm not ready to die.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
