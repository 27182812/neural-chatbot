Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
What's your problem?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
