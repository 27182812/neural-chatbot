Yes, wasn't it?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.

Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?

Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Did you finish the interview?
The Criminal Courts Building.
