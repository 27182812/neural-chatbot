You're a comedian?
Yeah. And an actor.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
It's not going to well?
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
