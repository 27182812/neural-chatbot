He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I don't get it.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
