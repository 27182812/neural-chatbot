Anything else I can get you?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
What if I like the pain?
