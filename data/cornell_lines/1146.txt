But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.

Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
