Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Yes -- an excellent idea.
