I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
