Bill.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew...
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Yeah, I guess you do.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
