The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
What is your location?
I...I don't know...
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Yes...
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
