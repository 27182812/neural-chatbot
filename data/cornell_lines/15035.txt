Still married, Jake?
Nope.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
What's wrong?
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
That black car?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.
You in trouble?
Yeah.
