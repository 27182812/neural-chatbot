What steps do we take now?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
