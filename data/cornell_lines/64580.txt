The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Right.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
