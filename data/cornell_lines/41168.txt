Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What are you doing now?
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Tell me what she looks like.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
