Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
