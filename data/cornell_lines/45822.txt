Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
Yeah, me too.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Sorry, comb got caught.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
How are you holding up in this weather?
I'll do.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
