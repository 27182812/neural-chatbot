Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
