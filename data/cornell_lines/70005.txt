A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
Your name?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Enough joking.
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
Very well.
Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
