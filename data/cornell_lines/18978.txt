No, sir.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it?
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!
