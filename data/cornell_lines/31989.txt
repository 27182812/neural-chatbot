If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Then what is he doing?
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
