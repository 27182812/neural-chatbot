I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
I can judge only by what I see.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
