This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Terry Valentine.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
