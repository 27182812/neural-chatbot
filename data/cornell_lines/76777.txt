I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help? I've no money...
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
