I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Your stuff?
The robbery.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
A report?
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
About what?
About the accident.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
I can't.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Because I don't know.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Somebody took my blender.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
