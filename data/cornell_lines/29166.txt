So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
And why not?
Whoa.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
What did... what did I want to be?
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
