Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Why not?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
