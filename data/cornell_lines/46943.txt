Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Do you have visual?
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
What's your ETA?
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
