This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
