Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
