How's it hanging, Miles?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Highliner.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
Say, is Maya working?
Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
