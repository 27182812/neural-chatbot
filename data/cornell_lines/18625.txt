I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
