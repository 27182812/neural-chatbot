I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
That's good money.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Then what?
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
