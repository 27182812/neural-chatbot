It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Yes?
My name is Travis.
Thank you, Travis.
