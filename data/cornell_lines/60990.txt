You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Who else is left?
Yes.  I see your point.
Why was there another team?
What?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
I don't quite follow you.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
