Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
