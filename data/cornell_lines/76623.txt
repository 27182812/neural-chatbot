Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
You think?
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
