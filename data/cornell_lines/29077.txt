Do you understand why I came here?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Don't you want to go?
I can leave anytime I want.
But that one night?
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
