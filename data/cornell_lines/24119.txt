You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
No --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
But I never said Rudy.
You said it a million times!
I never told you my name.
