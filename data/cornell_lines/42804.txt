You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
