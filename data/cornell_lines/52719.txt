Kido. It's four in the morning.
I can't sleep.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Do you love me Rachel?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Like a sister?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Like a real sister?
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
