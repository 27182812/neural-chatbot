You're just jealous.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Get away from me!
