A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
She never proved anything, not a thing!
But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
