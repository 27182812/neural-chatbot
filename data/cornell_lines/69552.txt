There were some shots.
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Where?
Here in the canyon.
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
What's gonna happen?
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Well, like what?
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
