Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Just about.  Show me again.
You betcha.
