I can't sing it anymore.
What?
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
What're you talking about?  They love it.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
