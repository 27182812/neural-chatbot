I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Good luck.
Thanks.
