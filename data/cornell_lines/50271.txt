My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
