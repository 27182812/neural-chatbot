So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
I think you're all an act.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
I know that.
Yeah?
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
