Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
I understand.
What do you do?
I make maps.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Eh... yes.
Make any money?
No.
You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
