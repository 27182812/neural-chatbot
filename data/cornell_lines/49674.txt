Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Nothing.

That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
