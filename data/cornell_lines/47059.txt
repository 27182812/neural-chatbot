Excuse me -
Yes?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Your friend?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Thank you.  Thank you.
