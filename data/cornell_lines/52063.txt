All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Some, a little.
Just for fun?
I guess so.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Like me?
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
