No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Not the Bible?
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
