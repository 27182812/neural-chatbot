What are you doing?!
I'm getting dressed.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
I've got my duties to attend to.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll be worried about me.
She'll get over it.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
You watch your tongue.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You know nothing about her!
When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
