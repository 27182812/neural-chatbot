Where are you staying while you're here?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
And how long are you here for?
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Must be nice having kids.
