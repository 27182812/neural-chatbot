I just come home to take a quick shower.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.

Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
What responsibilities?
I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
