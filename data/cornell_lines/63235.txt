Ahm... room service.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Right.
