Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Says you were a bully...
A bully? Moi?
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
I don't know.
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
