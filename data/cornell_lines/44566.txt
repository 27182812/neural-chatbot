Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.

Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
