[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Who ordered it?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
