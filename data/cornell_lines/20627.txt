Huh?
What are you doing here?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
