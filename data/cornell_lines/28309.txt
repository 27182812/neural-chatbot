And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.

You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
