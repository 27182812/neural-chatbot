I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
That's not enough.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
He saw my face too.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
Convenient, isn't it?
