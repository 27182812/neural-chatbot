Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
That's right, sir.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
You're right, sir.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Who do you think you're talking to?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Plan-R????
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Thank you, sir.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Yes, sir.
And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
