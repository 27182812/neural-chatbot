This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
I never scared anyone before.
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
Facts or theory?
Anything you've got.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
