We have a full caseload, Rog.
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Of course.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Right. You're right.
Damn right I'm right.
