Yeah?
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Is this a trick?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
We did make love?
Is that what you're calling it?
Answer the question!
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
What... ?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Marla, no, wait...
