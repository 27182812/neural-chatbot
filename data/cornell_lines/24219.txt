Switch seats with me.
What? No...
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
I'm ninety-two years old --
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
There is no other table --
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
