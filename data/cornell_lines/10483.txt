You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Print is dead.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Is that a game?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
I think it's the food of the future.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
