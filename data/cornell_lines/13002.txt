Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
