Where are you taking me?
South America.
South America!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
I'll get it annulled.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
What've you got against King Westley?
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You only met him once .
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men—particularly if you're a shining example.
