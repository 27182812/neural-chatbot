I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Why?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Relieved?
I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
