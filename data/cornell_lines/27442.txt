Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
And our people?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Are they in any danger?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
