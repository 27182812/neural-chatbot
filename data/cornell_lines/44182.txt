My daughter, Rachel.
Yummy.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Good luck, Sebastian.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Would you please leave.
