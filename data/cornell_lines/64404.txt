You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
What will they be made of?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Silicon is from sand.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
