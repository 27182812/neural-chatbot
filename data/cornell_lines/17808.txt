Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
They're not my pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
What if I don't?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Will it lower the curve?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
I wanna make a deal.
