So how are you?
I'm okay.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Well...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Probably not.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Have you?
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, you can tell me.
Come on.
No, I am.  I am.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Nobody ever said it.
Really?
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
No, the reason I ask is--
You've always hated my taste in the past.
No, I haven't.
You have.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
You're kidding me.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
