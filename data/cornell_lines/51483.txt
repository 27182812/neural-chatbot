And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
There's no people like you in my crowd.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
You're talking through your hat now.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
You were a soldier?
I was an officer.
