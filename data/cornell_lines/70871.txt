Anything this time?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
