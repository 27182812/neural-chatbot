You ought to write these stories down.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Why, do you think?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
You sound like an artist.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
I don't think you're normal.
