Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
