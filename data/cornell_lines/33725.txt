Birdie-
Hmm?
You don't like Eve, do you?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
An answer.
No.
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
How do you mean that?
