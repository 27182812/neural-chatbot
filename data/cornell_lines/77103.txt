Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
You don't say --
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
I see.  I see.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
No word at all?
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
