Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
I didn't mean -
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
