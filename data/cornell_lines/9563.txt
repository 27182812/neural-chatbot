I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
And dost thou live to ask it?
