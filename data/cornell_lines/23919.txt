Well, just get it off your chest, son.
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
You're absolutely right!
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
You what?
