When did it come across?
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Where's it coming from?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Is it coming from our own computer?
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
