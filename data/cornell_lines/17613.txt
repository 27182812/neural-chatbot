Charming, isn't she?
Yes, charming.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Suppose she should leave it?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
