Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Fine with me.
