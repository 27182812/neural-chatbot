You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
