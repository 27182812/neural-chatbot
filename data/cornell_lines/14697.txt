I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
How many trips did you make?
With ten thousand? Nine.
He's got that kinda money?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Cash poor?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
