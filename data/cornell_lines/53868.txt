Good evening, Lieutenant.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
It's late.
