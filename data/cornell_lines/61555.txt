Yes...what is it?
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
... What??
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
So, what did they say?
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
