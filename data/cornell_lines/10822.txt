Mrs. Robinson --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I don't believe you.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Go home now.
I just don't believe you would do that.
