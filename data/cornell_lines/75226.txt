Lieutenant --
Call me Vince.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
So the method of death is the only connection?
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
