Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
