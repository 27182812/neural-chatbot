Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
