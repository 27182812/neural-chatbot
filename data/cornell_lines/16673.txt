What happened?
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Who?
My father and the Baron.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
They tricked you.
My own father...
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
He did run?
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
