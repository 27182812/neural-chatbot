Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
And that's where you met Jenny.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
