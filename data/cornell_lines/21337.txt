Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Why not?
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
