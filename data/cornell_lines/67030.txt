I don't know...
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I...I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
