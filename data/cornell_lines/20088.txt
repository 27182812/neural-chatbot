When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
That's what I like.
Which thing?
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
That's one way to put it.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
