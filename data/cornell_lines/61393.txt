I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Are they worth reading?
I am told so.
Who by?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What does he know about the Highlands?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
That doesn't make him an expert.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
