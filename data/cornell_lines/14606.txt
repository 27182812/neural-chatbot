Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
