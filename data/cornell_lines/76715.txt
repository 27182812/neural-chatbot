I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Whose were they?
My father's.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Is that bad?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes... very.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
