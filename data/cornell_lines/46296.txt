So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Really?!  Well good for you.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
