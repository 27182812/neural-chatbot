You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
I'm thinking of it.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
