You know that sound, Oliver?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
You were at those battles as a spectator — — I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me —— those men out there —— dead or dying —— by my order -- because I willed it so.
