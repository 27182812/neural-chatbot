I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
What's the job?
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Why me?
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
Where?
Not yet.
I'm not jumping blind.
