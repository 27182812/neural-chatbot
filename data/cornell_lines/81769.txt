I can't believe your dad built this for you.
He didn't. He had it built.
Whatever.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
He phoned it in.
I see.
I doubt it.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
Your dad taught you everything.
I mean my father.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's all so complicated.
It's incredibly simple.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Eventually you'll let go.
And then what?
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
You're amazing.
I know.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
But you never do.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
