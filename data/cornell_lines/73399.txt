Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.
