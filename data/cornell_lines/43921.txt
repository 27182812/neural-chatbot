Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
You ask a lot of questions.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
You got it in a bar?
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
