And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I haven't seen her in months.
Ah!
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
