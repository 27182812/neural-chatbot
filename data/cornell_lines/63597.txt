Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I can't believe you did that!
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
