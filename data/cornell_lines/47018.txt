They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
You were in Africa?
Yeah, for a while.
So was my Patient.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
So you can shoot a pistol?
No.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Fine.  I'm not looking.
