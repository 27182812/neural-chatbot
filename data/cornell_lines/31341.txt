Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...

Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
