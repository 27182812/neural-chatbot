What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
