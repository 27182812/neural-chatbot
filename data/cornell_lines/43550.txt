The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
So - why the airport?
I work in the immigration department there.
