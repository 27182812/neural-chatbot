Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.

I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
Do you love me, Bobby?
