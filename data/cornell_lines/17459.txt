You don't look so good.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
