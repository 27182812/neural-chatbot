Aren't I worth waiting for?
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
