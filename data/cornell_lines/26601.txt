Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
What's the match gag?
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
