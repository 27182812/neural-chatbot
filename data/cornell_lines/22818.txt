What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
Aaabout...?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
A man?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
What did he want?
I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
