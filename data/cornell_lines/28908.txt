Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
I guess.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
What about Christmas?
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
