Dorothy Parker--
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Sure, why?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
