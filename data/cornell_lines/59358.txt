Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
Get him to Atlanta.
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What do you want to do?
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
