Great rehearsal.
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Who's the stiff?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Is he dying or something?
