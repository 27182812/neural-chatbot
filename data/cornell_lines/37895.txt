How do we do that?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
What's the play?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Never heard of it.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Great then.
Is there dancing?
No.
Who needs dancing?
