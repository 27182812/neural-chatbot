Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
Catch you later Freddy!
