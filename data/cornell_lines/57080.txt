I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Uh-huh...
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too.
