I didn't mean to hurt you.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You. what?
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm glad you do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Dorothy. no!
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. are you?
Yes.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
No. not really.  but also because I really want you to be alright.
