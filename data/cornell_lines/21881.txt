So you believed the bartender. Why?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.

Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
What doesn't?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I never said that I believed...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?

I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
Wesley...
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
