So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.
But what did you get on your SATs?
200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
