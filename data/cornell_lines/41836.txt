Listen, Arlo...
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...shit.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...-er.  It was your friend...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...shit.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
...split.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
...miles.

Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
