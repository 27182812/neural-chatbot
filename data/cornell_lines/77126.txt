Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Why do you say that?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
