Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
Not so fast.
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where?
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Where are you?
In my bed too.
How old are you and your sister?
We're little kids.
But roughly, how old?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
