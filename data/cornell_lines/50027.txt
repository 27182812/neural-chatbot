Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Fine!
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
The case!
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
