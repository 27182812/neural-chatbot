What are you doing?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Don't you have any savings?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
