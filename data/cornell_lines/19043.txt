Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
You living together?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Explain how that works.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
We see each other every couple of months.
Every couple of months, huh?
