Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
