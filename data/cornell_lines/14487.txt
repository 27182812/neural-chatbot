Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
What's the other name?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
