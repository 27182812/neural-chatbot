You amaze me, Commander.
How is that...?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
