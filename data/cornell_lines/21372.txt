Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
Yes, you approved it, sir.
I did?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.

We were working on China.
