I wanted to tell you my plan.
So tell me.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Really? To Italy?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Oh God, I don't think so.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Marge and I are getting married.
How?
How?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
I love Marge.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
Tom, I don't love you.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
