Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Can't it keep till morning?
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Will you go to bed?
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Scat!
