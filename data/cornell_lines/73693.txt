Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Brad.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Brad?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
