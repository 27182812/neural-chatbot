I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
