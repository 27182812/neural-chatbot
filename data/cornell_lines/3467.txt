You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Well you did.
Give me some?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
