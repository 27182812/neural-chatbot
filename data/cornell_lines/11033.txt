It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
There was -- there was.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
