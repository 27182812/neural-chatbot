You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
