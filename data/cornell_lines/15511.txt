Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
I am a suicide risk.
Is this Juno?
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Only the one in my pants.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Unfortunately, yes.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
