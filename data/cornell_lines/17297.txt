Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
