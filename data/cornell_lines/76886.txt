I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
What do ya want the others to get?
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
