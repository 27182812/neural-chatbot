You need some weed?
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Huh?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
This Rae... you get with her?
Shit. Who hasn't?
Why you say that?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Now, hold up.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
