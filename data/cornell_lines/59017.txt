I'm confused about your past is the thing.
Is that still lingering?
-- just to clarify --
So boring, so useless --
I would just want to clear some things up:
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
This isn't meant --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Are you asking me that?
Yes.
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
In aid of what?
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
It's all important --
Not really.
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
She does.  From when you were a boy.
Mm. Hm.
She lived in Tarzana.
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Go ahead and waste your time.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
And that's what you've heard?
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
