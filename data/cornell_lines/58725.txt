And what are you thinking we should do now?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
A lot of good that'll do.
We need all the help we can get.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way.
