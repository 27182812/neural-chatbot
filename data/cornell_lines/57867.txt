I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
