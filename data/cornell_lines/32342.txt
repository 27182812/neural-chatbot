I knew you'd want it again...
That's not why I called.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Santos... It isn't.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
What do you want me to do about it?
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Take care of him?
Yes.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Get rid of him?
Yes... Get rid of him.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Just tell me what you want.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
You need to explain it.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Santos...
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot him.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Yes.
Where? In the leg?
No.
Where?
In the head.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Yes.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Yes.
Through the forehead?
Yes.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
On one condition...
