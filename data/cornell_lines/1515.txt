Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
I don't want to live anymore.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.

That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
You're sure?
I'm sure.
