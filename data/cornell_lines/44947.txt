Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
A madman.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A crazy madman.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
A sweaty-toothed madman
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
