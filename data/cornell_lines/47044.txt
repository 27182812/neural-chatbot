Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Right.
Aren't you?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
What?
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
