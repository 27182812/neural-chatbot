You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" --
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
No.
Yes.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Listen to this, I love this part --
