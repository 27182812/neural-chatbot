You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
But your life and lands are far from here.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
