I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
