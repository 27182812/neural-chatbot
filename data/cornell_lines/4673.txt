This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Uh-huh.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.

Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh-huh.
