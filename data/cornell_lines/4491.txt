Book the good ones for where?
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
What shows?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
