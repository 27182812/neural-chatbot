So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
