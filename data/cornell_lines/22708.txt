That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
