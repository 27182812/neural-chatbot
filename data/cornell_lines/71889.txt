You mean a picture?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.

Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
The creature?
Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
