Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
