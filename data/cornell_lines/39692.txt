Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
So now you're asking for a student visa?
