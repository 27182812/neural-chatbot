So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
That suits you.
Uh, thanks.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
You're something else.
