My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Yeah?
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
One night stand?
No. I married a midget.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Oh?
Three foot one.
Be still my crotch.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Yeah. My brother told me.
And I think I'm going to.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
