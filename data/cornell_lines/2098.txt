My friend Jack was just here.
Your dead friend Jack?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
