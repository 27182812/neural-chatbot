You got the message Lecktor called...
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
What's it narrow down to?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
That's narrow?
When are you coming back?
When I'm done.
