Thanks, Dad.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
He's still married though, huh?
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.
Then they're not separated, are they?
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
No thanks.
You used to like it.
Dad...
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I really gotta go.
We don't get to talk much any more.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
I'd like that.
