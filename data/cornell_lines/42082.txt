I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Matter of fact I do.
Where?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
What's the maid's address?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
What for?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
