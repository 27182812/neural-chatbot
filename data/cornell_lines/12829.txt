Fuck, it's freezing.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
So.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Why?
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Yeah?
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
So what?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
