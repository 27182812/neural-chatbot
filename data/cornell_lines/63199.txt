... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.

I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
