Now what do we do?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
