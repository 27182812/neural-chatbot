OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
She told me.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
