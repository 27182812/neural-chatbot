So whose route is this?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
And he's where?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
You like it?
It's all right.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
