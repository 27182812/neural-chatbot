Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
Your Reverence.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
