What were you doing up there?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
What makes you so sure?
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
