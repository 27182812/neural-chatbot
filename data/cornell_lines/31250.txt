Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
What's in the two week package?
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
How real does it seem?
As real as any memory in your head.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.
