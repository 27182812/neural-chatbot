What is it?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
What are you talking about?
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
