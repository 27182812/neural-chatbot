Madame is wanted on the telephone.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
Paramount studios.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Very good, Madam.
