Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Why should you?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Nah.
I've got one for Cobb—
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Huh?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
