There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
He needn't disturb you.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
