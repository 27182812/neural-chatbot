Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
