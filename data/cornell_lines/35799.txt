Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
I've been around.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Sure. Excellent.
Here's the details.
