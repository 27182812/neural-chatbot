Can't you stop that?
Why?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
I know plenty of boys.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I do.
How?
I read.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
