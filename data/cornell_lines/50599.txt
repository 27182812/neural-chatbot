I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
What do we want?
Mystery. Deception.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What's sexy?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
