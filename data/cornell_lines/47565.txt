Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
What is it?
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
