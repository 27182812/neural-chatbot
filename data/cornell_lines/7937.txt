Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
I'm sorry.
