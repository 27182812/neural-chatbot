Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.

Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
