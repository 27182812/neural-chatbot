Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Buddy, you're just a child.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Well, nothin'.
