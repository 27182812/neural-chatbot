What's the hold up?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
