"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I agree...
