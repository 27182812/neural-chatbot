And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
