Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Wake up!
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
It's gonna be hot today.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
