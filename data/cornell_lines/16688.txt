What's this now?
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
