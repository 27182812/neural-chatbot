What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Blow where?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
How can we?  We're broke.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
But this is so humiliating.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
Me?  After Sugar?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
