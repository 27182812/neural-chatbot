Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
I certainly did.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
