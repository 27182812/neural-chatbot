How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
