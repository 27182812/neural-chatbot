Eughh. Sounds horrible.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
What?
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Cut it out.
When are you going to visit him?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
