Oh, dear.
What's the matter?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
I'll go search for it.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I'm not its master.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
