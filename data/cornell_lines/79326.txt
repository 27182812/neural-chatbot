Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Not a tiny little vial -
But a fuckin' baggie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
You're no longer an extra -
Or a bit player -
Or a supporting actor -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
