Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Still lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe...?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
The knife.  What knife?
