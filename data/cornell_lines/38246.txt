Tell me something, Skid --
Scud.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
