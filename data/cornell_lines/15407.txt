Hey man.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Yup.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Yup.
Did you hear it's yours?
Yup.

You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
