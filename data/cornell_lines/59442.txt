The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What would you call him?
