Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
You asked for it.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Name it.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
