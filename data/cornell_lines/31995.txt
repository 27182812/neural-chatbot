Yes?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Uh...sure...when?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Now?
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
