Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
