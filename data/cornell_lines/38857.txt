I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Good night.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
I would if I could get some sleep.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
Because I got caught.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
