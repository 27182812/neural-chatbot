How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
Your wife?
I'm not married.
Why?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
