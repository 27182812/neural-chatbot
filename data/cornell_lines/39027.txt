I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
An inquiry into what?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Did I say it was a natural death?
