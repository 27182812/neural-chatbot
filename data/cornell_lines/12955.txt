I want our boy back.
Oui.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
We still have you and I.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
