Go on, child.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
