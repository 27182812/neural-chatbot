Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Really?  Too bad.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
