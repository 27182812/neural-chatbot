Hello.
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Very good.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
What word did you leave last night?
The police haven't told you?
They think that you and I are doing this together.
