She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Sorry about interrupting...
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
Christy was nice...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She was hot.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
No, baby. You're money.
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Yeah, a good friend.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
How?
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
I just need some time...
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Don't remind me.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
...a day...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Selling scrap metal.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
He drives a carriage.
What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
I hear she's getting real fat.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
