It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Does she want to be?
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I agree.
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
