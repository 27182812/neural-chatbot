Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
