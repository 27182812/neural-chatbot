Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
That jelly you were talking to right here?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
So you made a generous contribution.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
What are you talking about?
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
You lost all our money in a card game?
He even got my daddy's watch.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
