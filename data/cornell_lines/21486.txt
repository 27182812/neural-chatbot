If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
