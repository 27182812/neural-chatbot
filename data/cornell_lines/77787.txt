You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
