How do you do.
Well, news of Buckley?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
