You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
A shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Yes, sir.
