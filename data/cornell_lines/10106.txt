Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Nothing.
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
