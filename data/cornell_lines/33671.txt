What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
Then you're crazy.
When - when are you coming back?
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
You in a hurry?
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Sing it?
Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...
