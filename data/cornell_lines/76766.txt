Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
What did you pay him?
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
I can look after myself!
They were taking you away.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
That's also my business.
