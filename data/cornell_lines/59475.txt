What were the yards like?
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
Yes. I'd considered it.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
May I keep the file?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
