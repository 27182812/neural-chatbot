I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
It ain't in me.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
I guess I'll rob a bank.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
