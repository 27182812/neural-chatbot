God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
