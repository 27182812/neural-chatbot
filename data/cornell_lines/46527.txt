Quite a shithole, isn't it?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
I was in jail.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
What...
Check forging.
Oh, man! So...
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
