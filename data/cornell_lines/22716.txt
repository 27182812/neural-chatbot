I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
You would do that?
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
