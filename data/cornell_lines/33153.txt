Are you supposed to be here?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
How'd you guess?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Gear?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Thank you.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
