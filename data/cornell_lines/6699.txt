Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
I don't want to move away.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
But why can't we stay here?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
No...
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
