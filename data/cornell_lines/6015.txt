Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Which I didn't have.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
