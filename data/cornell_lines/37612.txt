... Were you going somewhere?
No, Robert.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
... Oh? You've heard?
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
He does, does he?
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
