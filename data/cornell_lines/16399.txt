Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
