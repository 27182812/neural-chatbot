That's funny, Mr. Whale.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
You're serious.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
What rumors might those be?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
