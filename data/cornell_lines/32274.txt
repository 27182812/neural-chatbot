I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
We got through two states already.
