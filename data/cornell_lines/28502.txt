Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
How's the arm?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
He's moved on to TV.
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
