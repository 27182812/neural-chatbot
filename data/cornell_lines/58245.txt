How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Do whatever they tell you--
I mean, follow orders, sir.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
I do, sir.
Because it's a job?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Chaos.
