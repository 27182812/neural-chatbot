Bought it.
It's not your taste.
What did she say the down payment was?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
She bought it.
Why?
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
