I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
Oh no no -- no.
