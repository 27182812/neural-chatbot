Look at you... You want to go.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
It's more than that.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
How do you know I will?
Intuition.
