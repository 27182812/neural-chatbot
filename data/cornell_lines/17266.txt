Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
If you want to.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
"Octopus people?"
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
