From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.

But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
