Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
What was your deal with Job?
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
