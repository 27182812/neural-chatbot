How can I go?
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
What?
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
