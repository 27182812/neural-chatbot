You want to see me, Senator?
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
No?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
That's right.
Oh, now--that won't do--
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Nice *compliment*!
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
No?
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yeah?  And what else?
What do you mean?
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
