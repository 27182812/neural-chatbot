We look good this year.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Fuck him.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
What are we delivering?
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I like it.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
