What do you want?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
