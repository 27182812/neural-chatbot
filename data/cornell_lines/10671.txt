How much money is involved?
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Before they leave, get gold.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
