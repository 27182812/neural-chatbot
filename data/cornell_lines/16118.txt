Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Knowledge.
Of what?
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
Why must you know?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
You lie!
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
No.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
