So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Not at all.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
He's the best.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
Oh, no. I see the play.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
