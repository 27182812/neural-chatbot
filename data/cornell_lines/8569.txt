Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
...I see.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
