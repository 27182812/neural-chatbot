We have a lot in common.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Of course not.
You could help us.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
