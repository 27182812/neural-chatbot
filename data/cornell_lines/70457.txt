I told her she was going to meet her father.
You what?
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Yeah, like what?
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
