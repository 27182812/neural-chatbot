I have already rented the apartment to another family.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
How much more a month?
Eh...  Five dollars more.
