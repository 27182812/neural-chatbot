Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Fine.  Be that way.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
No.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
