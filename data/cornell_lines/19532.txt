You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
