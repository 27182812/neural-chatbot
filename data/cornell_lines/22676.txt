You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
