These are your paintings?
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Really?
