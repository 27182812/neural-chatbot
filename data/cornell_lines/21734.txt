I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Umm, I don't think that...
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
"Thirty-two?"
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
