Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
How's this about me?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
You're crazy.
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
