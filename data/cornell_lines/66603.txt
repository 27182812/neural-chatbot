If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
