I'm afraid it may storm.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
