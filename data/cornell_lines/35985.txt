Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know what you want --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
And why would that scare me?
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
