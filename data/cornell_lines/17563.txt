Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Why, of course. Yes.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
It certainly is.
Look here—
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
