Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
