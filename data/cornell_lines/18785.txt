Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
No, never in the slightest.
Just in dreams?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
