Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
It's important, sir!
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Aw screw it...
