Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
For what?
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
