Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
