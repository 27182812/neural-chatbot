Can I help you?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
