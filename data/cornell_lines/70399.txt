Yes sir.
So, you're really going to stay here?
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
