I thought you were with Amy.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
That's the Farren house.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
But I told her to go with you.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
You do that, Edward.
