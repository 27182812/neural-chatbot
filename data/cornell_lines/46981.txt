What?
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Would you let me pass?

Don't do this.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?

Dance with me.
No.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
