If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
