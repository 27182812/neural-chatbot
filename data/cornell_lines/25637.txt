Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Simone does not control my destiny.
Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
