Yeah?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Who's this?
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
