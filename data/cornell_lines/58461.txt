Are they treating you okay?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
I don't know where you'd start.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.
I can be very persuasive.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
