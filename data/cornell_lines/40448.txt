There isn't time.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
All right.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Football is my life.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
