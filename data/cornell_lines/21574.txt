That man that shot you died in prison.
In Angola. Yeah.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
