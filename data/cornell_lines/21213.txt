Is this what you call the "butler"?
Yes.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He takes good care of that.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
