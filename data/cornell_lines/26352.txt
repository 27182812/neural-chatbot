Hi.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Uh...
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Right.  That's true.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
There's a phone in the car.
