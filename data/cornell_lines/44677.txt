Nightmare...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Don't call the Vice President!

Just don't call him, Alan!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.

Bob...
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
