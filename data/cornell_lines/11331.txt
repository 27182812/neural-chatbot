Go to the funeral?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.

When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
