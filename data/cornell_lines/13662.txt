Somebody's been here.
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
No.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Right.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
