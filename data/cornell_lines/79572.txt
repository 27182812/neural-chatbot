You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a mad man.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
What makes you say that?
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
And what does that make you?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
