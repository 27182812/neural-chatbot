...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
