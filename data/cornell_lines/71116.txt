So when I left, she gave me these books.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
