Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
