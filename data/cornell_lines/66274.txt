How's your precious little school-marm today?
She's fine, as if you cared.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Lay off once, would you?
What'd I say?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
