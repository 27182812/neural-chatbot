I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Why?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
About what?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
So be here at three.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Yeah...see you at three.
