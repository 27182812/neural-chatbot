...yes I'm still on hold...
And what was this?
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
This is "Fly With Us?"
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
That's it.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
