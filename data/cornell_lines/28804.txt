Michael, what are those men doing?
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
