I got poked around... here and there.
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
No you don't.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
You never asked them about it?
Are you serious?
Not ever?
Not ever.
