Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Dear heart, where are you?
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
