... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
You could? How?
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
