I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
Whataya mean, no record?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
