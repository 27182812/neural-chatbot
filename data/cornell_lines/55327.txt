You said the slave had a crucifix...
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
The story about stakes through the heart?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
What about coffins?
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
