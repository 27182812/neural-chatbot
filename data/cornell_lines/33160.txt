Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
You can learn from books.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Out where?
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Books are good!
Parading's better!
Parading?
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
What's that mean?
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Oh ... I dunno.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
Yeah ... that's right.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
A book!
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
