So who -- what -- are you?
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Can you show me?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Why did you contact us?
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Many others.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
So who...?
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
So we passed some kind of test?
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
