I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
I'd love to.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Forty-one pages.
