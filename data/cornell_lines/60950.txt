The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
So what do you suggest?
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
