Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
