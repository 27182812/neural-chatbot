Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
