Where are we going?
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.

What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
