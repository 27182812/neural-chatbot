Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Breathe easy...
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
There is?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Just relax.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
