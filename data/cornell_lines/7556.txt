There's this guy!
What?
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Really? Is he cute?
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
