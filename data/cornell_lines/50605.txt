Opening night, Lillian.
Who the hell cares?
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
That's always been my problem.
And you've been extremely patient.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I'd forgotten that.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
That's very lovely actually.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Joanne Bourne.
Alma Wetzel.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
She's my gynecologist.
