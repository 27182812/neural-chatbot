Let go of me!
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I am committed. I love you.
