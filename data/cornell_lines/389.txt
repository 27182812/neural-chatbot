Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
