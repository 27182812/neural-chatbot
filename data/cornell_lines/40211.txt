Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
No! I want to talk about it now!
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Why not?!
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
