U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
What do they look like?
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
No.
How about California?
Would they be good to eat?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
