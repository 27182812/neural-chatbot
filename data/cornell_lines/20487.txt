The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
What is that?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
