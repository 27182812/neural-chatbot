Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Where is he now?
He had urgent business in the north.
