Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Yeah--
