Can we talk?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
You forgot to be there.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Stay!
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
Never had to.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
