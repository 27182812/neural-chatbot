My God, are you alright, Simone?
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
