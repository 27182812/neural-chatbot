I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
What 'look'?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
