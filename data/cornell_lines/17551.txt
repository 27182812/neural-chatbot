Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
