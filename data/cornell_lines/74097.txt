What're you writing, Lois?
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Two.
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.'
