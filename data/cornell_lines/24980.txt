When did you begin having this feeling?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
