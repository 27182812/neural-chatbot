And that's a bad thing?
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
You don't even know me.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Who?
That's none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
That's also none of your business.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Yes.
And you promise to abide by it?
Without question.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
What?
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
