So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
And you have no idea where he lives?
You've asked me that one three times.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
<u>Why you</u>?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Excuse me?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
