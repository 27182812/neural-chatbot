Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
No thanks, Lee.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Sure.
Well, what're you going to do?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Going back, huh?
That's right.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
How 'you gonna live?
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Okay.
Don't be too hard on him.
Hell, I'm just like him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Who is?!
Good-bye, Duff.
