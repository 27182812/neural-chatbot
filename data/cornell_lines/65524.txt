He... he just does.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
