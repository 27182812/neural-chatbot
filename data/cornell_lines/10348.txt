I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
I await the word of Vigo.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
