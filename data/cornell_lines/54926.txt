I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
I am not a frightened girl.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Of course not!
