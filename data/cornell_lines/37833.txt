You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
You're insane.
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
