Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Sleaze to peddle.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
