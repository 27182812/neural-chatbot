Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Lovebirds.
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
I understand completely, sir.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
No, of course not.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Aren't these lovebirds?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Doesn't what make me...?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
