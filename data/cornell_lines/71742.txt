... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
What do you mean -- not normal?
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Wait a minute.
What?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Yeah, why?
And you didn't tell anyone?
