God, how can you stand all these assholes?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
That rules!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
But those are our people...
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Like what?
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
