I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You did.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Right here someplace.
