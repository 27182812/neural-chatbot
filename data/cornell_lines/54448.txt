How did you meet Dr. Shea?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Yes.  It was.
