Where did everything go?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Doing what?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Instant divorce you mean?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Come on. You can't stay here.
I don't know where to go.
We'll find you a hotel.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
