And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
I apologize.
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Again? Good idea.
Diz--
Yeah.
How about getting married?
Good idea. When?
Any time.
Tonight?
Okay. You don't mind?
I'll cherish ya.
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Tunnel?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Is the wind tired out there?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Have *you*?
No.
Do we *have* to?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Well, let's get going.
Where?
We're gonna get married.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
What?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
What?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Okay--I mean--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
No--not offhand--
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Susan? Nah!
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
You said it!
I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
