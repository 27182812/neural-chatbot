Spunk, come back...
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
