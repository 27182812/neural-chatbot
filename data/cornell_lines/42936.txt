You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
You prefer nights?
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Me, specifically?
Why not?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Like what?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
