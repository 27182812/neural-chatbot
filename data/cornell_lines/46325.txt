I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
