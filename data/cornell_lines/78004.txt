Congratulations.
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
