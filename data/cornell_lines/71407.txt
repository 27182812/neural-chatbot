Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  Why do you want to kill more innocent people!  Why!
