It was you...
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Both of them?
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
This can't be happening?
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
