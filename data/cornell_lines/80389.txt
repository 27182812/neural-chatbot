Ow!!
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
What's tomorrow?
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
