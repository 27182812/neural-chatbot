Where's the car?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
What!? They brought the car here?
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
Have you seen it?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It's about time.
It is?
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
