Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
