Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
No. Roy. Roy V.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Seventy-five.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
