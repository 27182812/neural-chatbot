It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Yes. That is to say—
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
