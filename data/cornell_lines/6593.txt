I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
What flickering light?
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Yeah.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
