I- don't know what you're talking about!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
I ain't going no place with you!
