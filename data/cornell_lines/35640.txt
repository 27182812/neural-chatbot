Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Right.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
