Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Why? What has happened?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.
Where?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Is he working?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Is he working?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Opera? Opera!
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Are you sure it's an opera?
