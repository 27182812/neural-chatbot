Yes.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Correct.

You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
We'll find out now, won't we?
