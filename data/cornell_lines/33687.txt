And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Who?
The kid. Junior.
Gone.
I must have frightened her away.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...

What a body, what a voice.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
I will not calm down!
Don't calm down.

Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-

I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
Paranoiac!
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
