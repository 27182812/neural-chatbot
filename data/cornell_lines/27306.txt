So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
