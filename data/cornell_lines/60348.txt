You need to consider a few issues.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Sure.
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
