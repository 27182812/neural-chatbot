You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Don't be silly -– You're going to make summer better for them...
