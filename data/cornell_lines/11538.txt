You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
What the crap?
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Shit.
