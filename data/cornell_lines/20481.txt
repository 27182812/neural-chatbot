I haven't been there for three years.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
No, they're living in Nice now.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Ah-hh, no.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
