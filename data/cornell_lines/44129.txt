You know what? I don't take it back.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
I have feelings for you.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
That's not fair.
Why can't we be together?
