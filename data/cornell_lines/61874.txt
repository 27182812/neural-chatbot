Right.
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Good. I mean...
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
