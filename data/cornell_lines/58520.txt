My God.
What?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Yeah.  You could say that.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Not much.
You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
