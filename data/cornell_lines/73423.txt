You forgot this.
Thanks.
I've been hoping to run into you.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Why, you sweet kid.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
I didn't.
Thank you.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
