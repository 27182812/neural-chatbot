Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Somewhat.
Where does it make berth?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Why ask me?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
