She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Of course not.
If she paid you well?
Now, look...!
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
No. I told you, she's confined...
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
