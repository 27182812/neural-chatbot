That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
Aye.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Oh, aye, aye.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
