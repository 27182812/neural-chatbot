You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
