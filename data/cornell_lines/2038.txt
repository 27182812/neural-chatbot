Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
