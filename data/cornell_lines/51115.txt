...I thought that we were only talking...

Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.

I didn't ask to be.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
That's right.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
That's none of your fucking business...
