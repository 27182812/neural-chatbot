But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah, love again.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
I have no idea.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
