Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Have I ever let you down before--?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
I'm breaking no promises!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
