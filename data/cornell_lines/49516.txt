About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Fine.  I'll say no.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Fine.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
No, I have to work.
How un-sixties of you.
I was nine in the sixties.
I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...
