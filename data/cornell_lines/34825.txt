What do you mean, thank God?
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
