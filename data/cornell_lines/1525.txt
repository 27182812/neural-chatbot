You folks need any help?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
