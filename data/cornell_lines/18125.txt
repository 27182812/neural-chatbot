What exactly did they say?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They didn't say an address?
I told you what they said.
Nothing else.
Nothing.
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you...
