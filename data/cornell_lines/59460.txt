It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
You going back down to Florida after?
Yes. Is Molly there?
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
What's that?
Tell her I called.
