It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
I've never run across one like that.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Uh-huh!
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
What a pleasant hobby.
