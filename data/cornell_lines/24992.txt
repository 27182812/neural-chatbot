I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
No, I didn't.
Why not?
Because I never got around to it.
Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
No!
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what, then?
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
I don't know.
