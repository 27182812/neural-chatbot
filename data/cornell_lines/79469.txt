Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
