How do you play reality.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
