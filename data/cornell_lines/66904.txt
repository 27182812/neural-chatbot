No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
Enough!
