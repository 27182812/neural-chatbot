Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I am telling the truth.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
