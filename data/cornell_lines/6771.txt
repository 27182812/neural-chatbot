I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Max--
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
You left out condescending.
But there's another side--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
I'm the victim here.
Really?
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Exactly.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Does this person have a name?
Lydia.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
I'm a toy to her.
A toy?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
What happens if you level with her?
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
And why should she?
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
