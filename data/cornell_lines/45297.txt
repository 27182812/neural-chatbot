This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.

That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
