We're waiting on you.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
It's in the process.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
You should've done all this before.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
My pleasure --
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Negative.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
And not a nickel.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
And then?
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
I won't let 'em.
