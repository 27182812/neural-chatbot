I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
