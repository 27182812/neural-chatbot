Where you coming from?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens when you lose?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
