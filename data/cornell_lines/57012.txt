I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Thanks, Dad.
