Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
Why?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Yes.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
