Have you got a license?
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
What kind of a dog is he?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Well - what is he now?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
I don't want him.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
He only weighs ten ounces --
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
