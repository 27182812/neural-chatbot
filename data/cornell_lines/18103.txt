Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
What about boxing?
What about it?
What are you saying?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
So?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
It's not losing record.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Don't be shitty.
How am I being shitty?
Don't be shitty.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I'll page you.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Yeah. I know the number.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I know the number.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I got no idea.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I will.
I'll page you with the number.
Bye.
