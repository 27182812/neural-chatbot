Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
And why did you drop them?
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
