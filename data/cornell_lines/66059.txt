Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
What did you expect?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Actually, I am, though.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
But I'm curious, Rose.
