&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
What's that?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
...Who?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
But, you told me yourself...
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
What do you want me to do?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
What is it?  Can I help?
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
