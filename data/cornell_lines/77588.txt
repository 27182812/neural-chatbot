So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
You don't fish.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
