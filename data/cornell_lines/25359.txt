You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
About two-thirty.
Okay.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
