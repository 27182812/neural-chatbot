Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
