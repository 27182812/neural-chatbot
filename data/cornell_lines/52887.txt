I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
What?
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
You're joking.
No, he called late last night.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
And you, you-you're going?
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
But I'm seeing him.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
