For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
