[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
[No. Why?]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
