I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
