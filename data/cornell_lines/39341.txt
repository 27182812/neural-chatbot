Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
What the hell you talking about?
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
