So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
You don't know that.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
