Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
