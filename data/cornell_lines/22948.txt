Do you like them?
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
I know that.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
