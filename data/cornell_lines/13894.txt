Why did you stay with me?
Wanted to get to know you.
Why?
You seemed interesting.
Who else is interested in me?
What do you mean?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Were you working for him last night?
Last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
No, he didn't do that.
He didn't.
No.
Who did?
You did.
