It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I'm sorry about that.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Ben Schwarz.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Doesn't ring a bell.
