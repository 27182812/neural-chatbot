Is that funny?
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Why?
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
I didn't have any.
You had no inner feeling?
None.
Then I must have been supplying it.
