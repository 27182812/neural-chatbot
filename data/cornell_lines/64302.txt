. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Charlie? Was I dead?
I thought you were...for a while.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
What about Janet?
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
