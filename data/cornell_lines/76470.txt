Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
La what?
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Should I?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh... We split up.
Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
Oh no. I’m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
