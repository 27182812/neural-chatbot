I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
How many men are working with you on this?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
That's all you've had all this time?
That's it.
