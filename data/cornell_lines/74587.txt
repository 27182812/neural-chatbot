When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
And what was that?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
What telegram?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
