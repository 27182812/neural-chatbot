I'm not ...
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Yes.
Aye, I knew you were.
What's that mean?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
The big hammer?
Oh aye, a sledge.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
