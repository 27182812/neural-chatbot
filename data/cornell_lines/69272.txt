The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
Orsino…good name
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
and thus unable to declare her love
