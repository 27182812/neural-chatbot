Who've you told this to, Lenny?
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I've got all these signs here...
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
