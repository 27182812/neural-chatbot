Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She is relentless.
She wants to have an affair with me.
She said that?
Pretty much.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
So could you write down her exact address?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
Screw the rules.  I’m talking about the choice.
