You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
I'm not hungry.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
