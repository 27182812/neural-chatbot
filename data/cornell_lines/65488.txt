What did you do to him?
What do you mean?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Right.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Business.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
