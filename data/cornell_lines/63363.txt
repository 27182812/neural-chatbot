God Bless America.
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
No.
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Ca-na-da...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah...
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Ca-na-da...
Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me. Do ya understand?
