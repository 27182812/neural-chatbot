It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
I leave that in your hands.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
No -- not at all.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
