Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
You got beer?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Let me have a Beck's.
We ain't got no Beck's.
Kirin?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Genuine Draft?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
