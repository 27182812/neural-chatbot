Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Ed --
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Ed --
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
