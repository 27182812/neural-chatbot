Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?

I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
