Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Re-runs?
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Excuse me?
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
BUD.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
