What?
What desert?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
But how come I'd be there?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
A tortoise.  What's that?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
I never seen a turtle.
