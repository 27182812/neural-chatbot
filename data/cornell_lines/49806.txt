Are you all right, Doctor?
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Oh my God!
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
