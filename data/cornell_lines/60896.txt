We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Have you met them?
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
I've no doubt.
