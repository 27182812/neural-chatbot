What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
You made her a star?
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
And she's turned you into a servant.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
