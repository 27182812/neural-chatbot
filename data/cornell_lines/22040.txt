That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
I wrote. Not every week...
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
I never said any of that!
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
