You lied to me!
What?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Why would she lie?
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
