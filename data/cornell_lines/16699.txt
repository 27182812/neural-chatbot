What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
And as barren of love as stone.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Be fair, Oona.
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
