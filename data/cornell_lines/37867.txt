Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Vegas? What'd you think?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Impressions? Those are hard.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
A scary dream?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
I like that.
