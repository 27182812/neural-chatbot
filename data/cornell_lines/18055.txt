Oh my god. What happened?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Oh, please.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Who's watching the baby?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I'm ready.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
