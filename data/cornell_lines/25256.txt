Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
And she likes Pinot.

Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
She works for tips!
You're blind, dude. Blind.
