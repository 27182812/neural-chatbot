What is your proposal?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Of course.
Okay.Up to the cave.
