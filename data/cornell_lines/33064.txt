Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
That's ridiculous...
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
I've already told you what I thought.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
It's possible isn't it?
Who?
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
