I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in.

That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
