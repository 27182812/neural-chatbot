I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Mitchell knew then.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Haldeman too?
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
