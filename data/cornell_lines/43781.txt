Someone else coming?
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?

You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
