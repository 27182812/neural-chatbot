See?  Nothing.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
What happened?
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Oh, no!
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Talk about sad.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
You poor, poor boy.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
What else is there for me?
Is it that hopeless?
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Have you ever tried American girls?
Why?
