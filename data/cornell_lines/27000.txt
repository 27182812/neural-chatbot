Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
I -- saw no future --
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Yes, I was...
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
But -- why?
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Then, how --
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Of course...!
