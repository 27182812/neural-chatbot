Are you Pierce Patchett?
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Richard Stensland.
I don't know him.  Mr...
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Of course...
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
