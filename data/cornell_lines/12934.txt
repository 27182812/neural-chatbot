Shall we close up, then?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Yes. Happy happy.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
