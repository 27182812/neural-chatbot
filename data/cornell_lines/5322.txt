You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
He electrocuted someone?
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
His name was Swifty?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
That's too bad.
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
