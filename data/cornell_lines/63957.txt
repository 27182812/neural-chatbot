Shut up.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Daniel.  Listen --
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
All right, but...
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Sure, Daniel.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
That's all I wanted to know.
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
