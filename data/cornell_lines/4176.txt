I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
She's around. Always is.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
You need a ride?
