What was his voice like?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Did he pay?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
And Oswald?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
