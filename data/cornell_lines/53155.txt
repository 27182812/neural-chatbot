<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Who would that be.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..?
