The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
I was with the Princess.
Where?
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Go on... go on...
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
And did you?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
That's it then... the ring!
