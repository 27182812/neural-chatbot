Price?  What do you mean?
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
But tell me why ...
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
