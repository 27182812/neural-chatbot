Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, how much money was that?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
No, no, fax is -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Okay.
Okay, real good, then.
