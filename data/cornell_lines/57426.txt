Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
I suppose...
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
Yes.
How long was that?
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
