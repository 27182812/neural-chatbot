We must talk.
Stay out of it.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
