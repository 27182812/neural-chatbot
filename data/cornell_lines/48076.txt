Sure, why not.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
That's what we agreed.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I'm not unhappy.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
