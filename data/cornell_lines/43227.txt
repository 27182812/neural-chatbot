Ellie -- are you okay?
I'm -- I'm fine.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
What day?
How long was I gone?
