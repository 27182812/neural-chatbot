What is it?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
You're kidding.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
