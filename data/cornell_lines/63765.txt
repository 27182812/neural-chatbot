Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
That goes double for me.
