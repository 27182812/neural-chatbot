I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
A blueprint spool.
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days.  I left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
But you can't call me while you think?
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
