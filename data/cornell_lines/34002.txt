OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
I did all right on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
You can't believe that.
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
