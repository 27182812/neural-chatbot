Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
No ... just keep him in here.
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Just you ...
