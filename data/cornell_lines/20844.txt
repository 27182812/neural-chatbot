That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
I'll bet.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
