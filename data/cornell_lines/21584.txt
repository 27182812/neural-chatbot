Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
You ain't heard from him?
No I ain't.
Nothin'?
Not word one.
Would you tell me if you had?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
He won't neither. He never has.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
He can take all comers.
