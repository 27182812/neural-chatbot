I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
