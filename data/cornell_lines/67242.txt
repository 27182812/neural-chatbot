I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Who?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
How do you know he's our man?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
You sound like that all the time.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
