What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
I want money.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Freedom.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
Money.
And Diego?
Diego is my brother.
