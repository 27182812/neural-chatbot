I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Let's go.
