Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
That would definitely explain it.
