Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
What's the matter with my printing?
