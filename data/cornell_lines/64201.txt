There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
We're all going away.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
