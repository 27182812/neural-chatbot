"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
No.  He's never asked me.
Why don't you ask him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
