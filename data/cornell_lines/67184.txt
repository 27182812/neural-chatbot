That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
So someone did get away.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
