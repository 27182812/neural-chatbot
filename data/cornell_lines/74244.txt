Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Daddy?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
News?
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
That's not news, Zoe.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
