Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You're just doing your job.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You're detestable.
And you're late!
