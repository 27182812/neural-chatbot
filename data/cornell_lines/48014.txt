You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
I've seen him.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
I once did a paper on it
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
It's possible. Possible however…
Unlikely.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Sick priest, is that it?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No I probably wouldn't.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Is that a threat?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
