You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
It is.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
