Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Now don't that call for an extra!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
We'll grant that.
What!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Let it go.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
What do you mean?
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
No kiddin'?
Almost certain.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
