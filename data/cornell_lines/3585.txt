You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
What you did is dead wrong.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I don't believe it.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
