Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
It could mean that, yes.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
It's possible.
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
