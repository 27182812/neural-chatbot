We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it.
