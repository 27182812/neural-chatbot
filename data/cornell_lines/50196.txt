You call your son Little Chief?
Uh huh...
What'd you say your name was?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
