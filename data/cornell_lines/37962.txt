This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
For what?
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Just me.
You planning to do anything about it?
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
