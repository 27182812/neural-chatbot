Let me just ask you a serious question first.
What?
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
If sheep don't count.
That wasn't me ...
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
