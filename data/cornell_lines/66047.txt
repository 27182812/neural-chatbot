She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Dysfunctional --
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
And glow happily ever after.
