Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Why not?
Because I love you...
Then it's not too late for us...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I know, I've felt it...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
