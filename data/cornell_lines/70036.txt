Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
What?
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
But -- why?
I must go where I can be of use.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
