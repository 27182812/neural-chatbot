What kind of a crash was it?
You seen my suitcase?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?

Four.  Four years --
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
