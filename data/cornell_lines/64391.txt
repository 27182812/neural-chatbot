And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
What's that?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I	know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
What's inside?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
