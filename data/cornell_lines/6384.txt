He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
