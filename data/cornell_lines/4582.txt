Where are we going?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
No, I'm lost.
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
