Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
You put it very well.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Entirely.
