At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Flaws.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
