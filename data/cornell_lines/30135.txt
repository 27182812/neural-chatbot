Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
I see.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Exactly correct, sir.
