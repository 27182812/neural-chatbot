But it's on the water.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
