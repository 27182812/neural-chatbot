Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
