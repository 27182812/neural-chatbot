Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
No...!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
That's now what I meant...
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yes, but...
And you didn't jump of your free will?
No!
Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you then?
