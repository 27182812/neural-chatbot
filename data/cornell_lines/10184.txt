Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
She's not at home?
No... they said she was here...
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
That slut!
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Did she say that?
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
