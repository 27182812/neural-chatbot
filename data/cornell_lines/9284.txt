Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
