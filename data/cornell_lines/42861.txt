I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
What?
Sixth is faster.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
