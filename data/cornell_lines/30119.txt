The mud carriers.
I can see Kalen's point.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
What's it all for?
I don't understand.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Or mud carriers.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
What are you?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
How do you decide?
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
