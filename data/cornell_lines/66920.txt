He's tough, your American friend.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Of course.  Don't you?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Not exactly.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
How did you know?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
