Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
Yes.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
You're welcome.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes. That is surprising.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
I hope so.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
No. I don't object.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Which view?
