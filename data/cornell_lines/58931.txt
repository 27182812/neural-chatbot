I don't wanna talk to you.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --

Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
