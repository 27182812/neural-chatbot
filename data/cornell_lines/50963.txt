Listen... how much money did you make this year?
What's it to you?
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You serious?
Sure am.
And I keep my mouth shut?
That's what I want.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You got it.
How about twenty thousand?
