Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
No, ma'am.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Do that.
