Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
How did she die?  I wanna know.
You don't wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
