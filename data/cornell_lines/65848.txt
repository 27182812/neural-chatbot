Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
It's been three.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
I feel better when you feel better.
Where's the old highway?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Yes.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!

An hour! Or less!
