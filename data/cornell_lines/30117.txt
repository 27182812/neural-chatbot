Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Yes.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Yes!
We all have that dream.
All of you?
Every night.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
We share everything.
