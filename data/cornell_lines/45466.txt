Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
You mean -- a jury trial?
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
