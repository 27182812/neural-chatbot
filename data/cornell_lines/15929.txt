A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
That's got to be it.
