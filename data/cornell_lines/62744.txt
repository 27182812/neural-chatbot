When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.

Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Too late?
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
