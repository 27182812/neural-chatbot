Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
