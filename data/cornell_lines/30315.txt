Honey?
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
What?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Why?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
On what?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
In the leg.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
