Where did you get this power?
The power was within you.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Join my quest.
What is it you seek?
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
But how?
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
