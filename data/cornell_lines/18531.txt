Ah?
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Who?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
When was this?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
What they say?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
