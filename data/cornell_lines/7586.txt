So go.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
What if you stay this time?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
