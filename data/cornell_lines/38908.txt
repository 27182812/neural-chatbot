You mad at me?
Not mad.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
