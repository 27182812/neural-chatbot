Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Remember what we talked about?
We talked about a lot of things.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
That's enough, Fran.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
You're not being funny.
I wasn't trying.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Okay. I'm sorry.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Handle what?
What do you think?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
You know I do.
Fran --
