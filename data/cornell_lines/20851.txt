'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
When'll the skiff be ready?
And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
