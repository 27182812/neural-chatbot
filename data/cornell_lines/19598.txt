Are you ready for him, Bill?
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
How do you feel, champ?
All right, why?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Oh! Go away.
