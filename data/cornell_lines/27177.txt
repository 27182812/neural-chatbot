Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Very well.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
And why not?
Because... there was no way to win.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
... No, sir. It has not.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
