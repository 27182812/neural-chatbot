Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
I said, the northwest valley.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
