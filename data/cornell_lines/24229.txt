Seymour Scagnetti.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
