Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
