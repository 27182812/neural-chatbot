I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
