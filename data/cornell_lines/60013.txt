C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Love.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
You love Allison, don't you?
Oh yes, I do.
How did you meet?
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
But she loves you?
