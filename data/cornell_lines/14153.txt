Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
What?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
He's the wrong man.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
