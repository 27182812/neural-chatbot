We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.
Send that?
Would you?
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
