It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
You were just a kid.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
