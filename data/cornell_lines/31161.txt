You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.

Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
So why am I still alive?
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
