Any idea where you're going?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
They did some great job of reforming you.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Think you could do a picture of me?
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
