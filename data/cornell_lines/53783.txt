Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Here, take this out to the table.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
