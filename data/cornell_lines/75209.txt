I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
