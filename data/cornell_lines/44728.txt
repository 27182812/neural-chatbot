Yes, Mr. President?
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
And it's proving quite effective...
Does it make the cars any better?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Perceptual?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Why?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
