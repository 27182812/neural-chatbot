Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
No.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
No, I wanted other things for you.
You wanted me to be your son.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Then why have I become a man like you?
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
What else do you believe in?
