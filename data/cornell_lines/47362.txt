But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
So what made you think it was?
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
What medical records?
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
