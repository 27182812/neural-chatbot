Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Yes...
