It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
