What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
That's it. You get it quick.
But where do the rats come in?
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
