I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
How the hell did he find it?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Great...
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I know.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
