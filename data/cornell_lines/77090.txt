Who's that man?
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
I don't like him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
What bonds?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
That's my business.
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
