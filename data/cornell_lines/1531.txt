Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
