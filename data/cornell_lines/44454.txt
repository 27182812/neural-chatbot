How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Why the fuck would you do that?
I could smell another woman on him.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
