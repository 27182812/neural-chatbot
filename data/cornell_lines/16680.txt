No!  I won't let it happen...
You've freed me, Jack...
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
What?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Sunlight?
That's why he goes masked during the day...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
And I... love you...
