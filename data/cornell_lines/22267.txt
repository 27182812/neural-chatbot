Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Huh uh.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What if I keep dropping?
Not an option.
What if I do?
