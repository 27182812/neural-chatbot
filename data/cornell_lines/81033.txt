It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...  Gemme the Pentagon.  List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind.  Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"...
