You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
But my mom gave me the map.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
