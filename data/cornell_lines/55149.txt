We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
You know my plan of action.
To do nothing.
That's right.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
He's asking everybody questions.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
He's just rattling your cage.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
