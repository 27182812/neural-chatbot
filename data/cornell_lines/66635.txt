Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
...No.
Think about it.
Yeah, sure.
