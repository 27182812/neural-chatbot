Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
