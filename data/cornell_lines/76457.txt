What sort of puppy are you looking for?
What sort have you got?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
Yeah.
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Yes... Good, good...
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Tomorrow?
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
I see. How much?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
Have the money ready by 11am. We’ll call you.
