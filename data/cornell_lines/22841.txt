And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
