They're not bad.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
My what?
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Exactly.  And he got good.
No kidding.
