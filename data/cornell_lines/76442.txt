Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
