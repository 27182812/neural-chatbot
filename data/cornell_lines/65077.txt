Private eye?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What are your rates?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
