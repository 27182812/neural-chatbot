A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
What do you mean?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
