Geez.
What the hell are you doing?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
None.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
That's funny.
