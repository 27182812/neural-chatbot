I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
I'd love to go there one time...
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
