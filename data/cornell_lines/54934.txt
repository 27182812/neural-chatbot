You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I love Fort Holland.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
You didn't drive her mad.
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
