What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
