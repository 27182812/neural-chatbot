I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Strike out, eh?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
When ya go back on?
Morning.  Sometime.
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
