It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
You're right -- I am a coward.
