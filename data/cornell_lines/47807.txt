Good day to you, sir.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Move aside!
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
