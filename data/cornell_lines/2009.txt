Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
But what is it they don't like?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
