We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
Why would I let you do that?
I know where the money is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I know something better.
What's that.
I know where it's going to be.
And where is that.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
