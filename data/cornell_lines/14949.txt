What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
I don't want to know.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
She was good in bed, though.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
