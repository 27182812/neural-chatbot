What about Bill?
What about Bill?
He's in love with you.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Why should he - and why should you?
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Isn't that what they always say?
