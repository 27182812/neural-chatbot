You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Admittedly...
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
The stock will turn.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
What?
Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
