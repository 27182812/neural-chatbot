Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
It was different...
What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
I've never LOVED anybody!
I've never been to bed with anybody!
