Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
I've been preoccupied.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
How much longer?
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
