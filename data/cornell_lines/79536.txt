Where's the safe?
I don't know.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
Don't yell at me!
