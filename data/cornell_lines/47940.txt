So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Where?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
Did he tell you about my party?
Sure did.
About my daughter?
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention?
No.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
That depends.
On what?
The priest.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
You wouldn't.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I beg your pardon?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
I didn't get you?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Oh yeah, since when?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
