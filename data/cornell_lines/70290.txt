Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
