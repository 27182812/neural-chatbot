Hello, Smith.
Holy jumping swordfish!
I suppose you know why I came—?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
Surely, come right in.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
I don't eat waffles.
You don't.
