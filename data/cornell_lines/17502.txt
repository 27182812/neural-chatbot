Good book, huh?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
What night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I called, you know.
Called? When?
From the club. You didn't answer.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
