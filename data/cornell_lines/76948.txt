I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
You move right along, don't ya.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
