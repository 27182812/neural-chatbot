Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Why would he pick this one?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Not that I know.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
