What did you think of that Wadja film?
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I thought it was tremendous.
I think it went on rather too long.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
Oh, but he was terrific.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
