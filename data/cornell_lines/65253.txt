Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
