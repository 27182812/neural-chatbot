An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
And the result satisfies.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Sire.
Well. There it is.
