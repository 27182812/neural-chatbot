So what do I do?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Whatever.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Don't curse.
There you go.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
