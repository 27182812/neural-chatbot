Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
You seem fine now.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
