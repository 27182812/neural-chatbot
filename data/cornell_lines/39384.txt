I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Have you ever been inside?
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
And what's that?
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
