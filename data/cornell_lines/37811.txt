I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
