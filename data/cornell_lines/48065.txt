By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
No thanks.
No, I mean it.
So do I.
We gotta go, Jack.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
This time you gotta go.
I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Says who?
Your older brother.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
