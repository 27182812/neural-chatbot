What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
This life.
This life?
Why do I have this life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Thirty-seven.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
