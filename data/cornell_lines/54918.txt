Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
