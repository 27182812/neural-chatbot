Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Who are you?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Why should I?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
I don't know what you mean.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
