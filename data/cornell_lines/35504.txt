No!!!
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Uh-huh...
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
How to die, mostly.
