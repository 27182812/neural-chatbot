Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
