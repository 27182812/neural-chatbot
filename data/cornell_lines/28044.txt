Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I’ll snap its ugly head off.
What's this all about?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
You're not Reman.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
I won't defend my life to you.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
