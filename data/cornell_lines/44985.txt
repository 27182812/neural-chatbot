What is it then?
I... I just don't want to come.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
Yes.  But
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
What?
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
