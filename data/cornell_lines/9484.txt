Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.

Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
