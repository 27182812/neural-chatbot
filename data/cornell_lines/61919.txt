Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
You couldn't?
Well I'm sort of involved.
Sort of?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
