I didn't think they even enforced this.
Living proof.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
I don't; you did.
Really?
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Holy shit. That girl?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Then how come you got the fine?
Because I'm here.
You're lying.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Because I'm happy.
You're happy?
I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
What did she say?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
You're kidding.
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Hey, what about Veronica?
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You're a snake.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I'll read the book.
