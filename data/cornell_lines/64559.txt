You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
That's right.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Absolutely.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
