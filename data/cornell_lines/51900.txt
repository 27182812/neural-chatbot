Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
It's a way outta here.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
You don't know that.
Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
