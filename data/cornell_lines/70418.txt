Is he leaving right this minute?
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I didn't mean that.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Where will he go?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Will he be supervised?
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
