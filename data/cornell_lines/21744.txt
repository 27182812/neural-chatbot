Did you watch it yet?
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!

Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
No... what about your sister?
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
