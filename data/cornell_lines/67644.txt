I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
And you're worried about him.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
