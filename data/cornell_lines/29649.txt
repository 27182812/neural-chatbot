Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Tell me what?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
