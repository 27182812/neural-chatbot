You mean--here?
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Have you always had to--work?
Since sixteen or so.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
No complaints.
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Have I?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
I don't see where we are *with* it.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Go right ahead.
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Terrible, thank you.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Why?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
I also answer to whistles.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Well, if it's all the same to you--
I know. It's--Violet.
It *is* not!
Abigail.
No!
Letitia.
No!
Lena.
No! Stop it!
I've got more. You better tell me.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
