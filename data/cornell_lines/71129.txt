You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
They probly thought you was crazy.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
