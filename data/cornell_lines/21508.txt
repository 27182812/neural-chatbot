You all right?
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
That was a long time ago.
