And did you?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
Why did you stop?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Do you miss it?
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
