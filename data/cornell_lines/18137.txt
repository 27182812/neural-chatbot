Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
What's up?
He wants to see us now.
Where?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
We're getting whacked.
We're not getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
