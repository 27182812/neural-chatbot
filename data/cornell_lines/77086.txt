Don't mind what she says, Chris.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
I said all right!
