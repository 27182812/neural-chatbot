Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways.

Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Goodbye.
