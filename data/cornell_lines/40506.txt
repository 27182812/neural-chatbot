What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
