Well...Annie for one.
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
You can’t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
