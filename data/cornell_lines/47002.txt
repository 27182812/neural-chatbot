And where are the Expedition Maps?
In my room.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
What's the matter with you?
Don't be so bloody naïve.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
