Gal, you ain't right yet.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
How you let men treat ya like they do?
What?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
