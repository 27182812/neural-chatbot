Nice shot.
Thank you, sir.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I've tried to change her mind.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
