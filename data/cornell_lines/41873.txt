Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You, Arlo.
Hello.
You.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Us.  Owes us.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
