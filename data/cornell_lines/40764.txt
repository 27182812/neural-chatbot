Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
Why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
I...
...position...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
...and she doesn't always -
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
It's always been our policy -
No. Just stop everything.
