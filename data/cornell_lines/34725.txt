Don't get it.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
What?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You want me to uninvite her?
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
