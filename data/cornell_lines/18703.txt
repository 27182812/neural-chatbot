Godless buffoons, all of them.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
