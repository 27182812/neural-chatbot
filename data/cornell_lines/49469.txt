Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
