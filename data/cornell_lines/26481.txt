So, uh... how's college goin'?
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
You stop him?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
