Goodnight, honey.
Don't I get a kiss?
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
We can be real quiet...
I love that you're my wife.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
You bring me such peace...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Don't wake the kids...
Ooohhhh!
