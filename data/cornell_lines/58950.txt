This is my job.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
If you're not here for a 422 --
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
I'm sorry.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Just Jim.

Bye, bye, Claudia.
Good bye.
