No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Sam Lowry.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
What?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You want to take my console into your office?
Yes.
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing.
