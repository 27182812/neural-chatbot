You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
