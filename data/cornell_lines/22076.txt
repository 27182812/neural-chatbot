Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Yes I do!
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
