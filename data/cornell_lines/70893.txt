Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
Go where?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
I never join nothin'.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
