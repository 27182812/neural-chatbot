You want my heart?
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
