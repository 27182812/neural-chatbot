Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
Not tonight.
What's the matter?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
I haven't been invited.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
