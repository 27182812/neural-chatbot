My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Archie.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Yes, ma'am.
