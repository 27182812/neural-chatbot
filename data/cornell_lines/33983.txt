You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
