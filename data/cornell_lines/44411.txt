That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Nearly four.
How have you been feeling?
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Does she have PMS?
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
