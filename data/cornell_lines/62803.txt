So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Okay. That's bad.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
