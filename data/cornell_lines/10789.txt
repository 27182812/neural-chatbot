Did you get us a room?
What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Do you want to get it now?
Now?
Yes.
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't you get it.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
