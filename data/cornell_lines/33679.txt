Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I thought you were going to be late-
When I'm guest of honor?
I had no idea you were even here.
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
That never stopped you before.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
She's a girl of so many interests.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
So she seems.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
