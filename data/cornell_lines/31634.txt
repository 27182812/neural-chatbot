James called me last night looking for you.
When?
The usual, 9:15.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
I don't know what to do.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
