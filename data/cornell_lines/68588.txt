Hello?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
Who the fuck is this?
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
