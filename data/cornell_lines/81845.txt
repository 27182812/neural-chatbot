Did you try to fight him?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Then what?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew...
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Try, Kelly.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
