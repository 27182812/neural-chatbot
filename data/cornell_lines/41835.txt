You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
We were nationally  ranked.
How wonderful for you.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
Robert Del Rio?
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
...hospital.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
We got two paddles.
