I know.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
You being audited?
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
That's temporary.
Bullshit.
Rachel--
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
How?
Tell me about Brill.
