I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
