Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
No, it's okay.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
It's all right. I'm fine.
