You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Did you know that when you married him?
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
