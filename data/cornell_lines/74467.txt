Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
My mission is to protect you.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
