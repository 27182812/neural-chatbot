"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
What about him.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.

Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
