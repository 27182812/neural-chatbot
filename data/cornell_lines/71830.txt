Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
You don't understand about the sphere.
Then explain it to me.
