Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
Your Majesty has had many women --
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
At least help Raoul.
Silence!  I order you!
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Thank you, your Majesty.
