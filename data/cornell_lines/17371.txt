There's a Sanctuary... there is!
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
