Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
