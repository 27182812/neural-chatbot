You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
