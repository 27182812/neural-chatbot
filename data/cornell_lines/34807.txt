How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Yes.  Fine.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
I never like to talk about my work.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
No.  Not something new.
Well, something's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Um.  Happy for you.
Thanks.
So tell me, how's it going?
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
You're my best friend.
That's not an answer, is it?
Yes, you're a monster.
