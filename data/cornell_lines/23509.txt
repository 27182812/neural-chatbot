The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
