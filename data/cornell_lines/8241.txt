Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
