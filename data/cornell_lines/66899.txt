Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
We'll double your price.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Do you have the material?
You first, Edvard.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
I think not.  After you...
