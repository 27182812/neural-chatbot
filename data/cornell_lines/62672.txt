I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Good, because you've got a new one.
