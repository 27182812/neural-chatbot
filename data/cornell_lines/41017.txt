Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
