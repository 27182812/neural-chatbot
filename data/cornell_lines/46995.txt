Safe journey.
You too.  Good luck!
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Appropriate?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Very well.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
