I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
That would complicate things.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
He knows that?  Billy?
Yes.  He does.
Billy said that?
