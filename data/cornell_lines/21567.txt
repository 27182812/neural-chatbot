Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Won or lost?
Lost.
Someday, Dick.
