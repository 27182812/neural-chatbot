What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
They shot him in his library.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Gone.  Not a trace.
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
