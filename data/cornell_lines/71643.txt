A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
What if it attacks?
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
High Voltage?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Forty yards.
But you've tested it?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Thirty yards.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
