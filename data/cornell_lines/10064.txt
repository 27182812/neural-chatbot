I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
What are you talking about?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Just promise you'll do it.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
