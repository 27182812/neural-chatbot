There's Ilona.
What about her?
Get something going there.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
She's... young.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
Who?
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
