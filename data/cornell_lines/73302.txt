No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Don't do that.
What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...
Yeah?

Your manager?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
