Did all these people die in wars?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
