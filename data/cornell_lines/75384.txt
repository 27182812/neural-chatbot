I've got to talk to you.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
Your Dad?!
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
Who?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
How about them?
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
I told you I can't.
I've got to show you something.
