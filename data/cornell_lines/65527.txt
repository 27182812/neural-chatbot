I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.
Dummy.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I pray for that.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Go for the bucks.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
