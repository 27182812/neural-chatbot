What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Certainly not!
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
