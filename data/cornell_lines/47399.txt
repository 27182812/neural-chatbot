What kind of things come up?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Whoa.  No shit.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
So what are you thinking?
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
