Mom, please?
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
This is me telling you about me.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Alright.
You will?
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
