John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Someone will find me.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
