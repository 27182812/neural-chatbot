Would you have shot if it was a man?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
That's not right.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
I think you're the liar.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
