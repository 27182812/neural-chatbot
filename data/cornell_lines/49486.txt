You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
You were great. Thanks alot.
