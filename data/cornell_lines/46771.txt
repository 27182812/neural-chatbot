Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Some reality.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Why not?
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
