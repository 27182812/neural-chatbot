Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Big joke!
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Why?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
I cut myself shaving.
You shave with your spats on?
I sleep with my spats on.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
You and who else?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
