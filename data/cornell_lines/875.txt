You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
