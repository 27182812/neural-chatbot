Where are you going, Baxter?
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
I'm not through with you yet.
Yes, sir.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
How would you like to go tonight?
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Swap them? For what?
