Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Why of course --
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Dan'l Webster?
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Yes.
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
