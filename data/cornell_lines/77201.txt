What kind of mine?
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
