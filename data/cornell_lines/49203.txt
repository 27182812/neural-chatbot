Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Yeah, how?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
