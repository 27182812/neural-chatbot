Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You've done five of my ideas.

They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
A--flack jacket.

Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Hey--I can be out of control.
