What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
It's fine.
It's only temporary.
It's not that --
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
I don't think I belong here.
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
They're all the same.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I should leave.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
