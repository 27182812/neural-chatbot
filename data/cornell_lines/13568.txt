There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
Two are still missing.

That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
