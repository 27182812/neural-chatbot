So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
A whole ten cents?!
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Sure. If you like.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
