Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean.
