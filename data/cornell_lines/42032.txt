You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Thanks.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
It doesn't hurt.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Probably.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
