What'd you find up there?
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
She was sailing up north, right?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
