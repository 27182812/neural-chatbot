Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Almost right.
I can't wait to meet her.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Viktor, it's my studio.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
