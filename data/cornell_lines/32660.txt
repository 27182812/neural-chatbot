How do you feel about that?
I don't feel anything.
You have no feelings for your niece?
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Then why are you talking about this?
Have to talk about something.
What are you afraid will happen?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I'm not that crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Why do you think you're here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Is that what you are angry about?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
