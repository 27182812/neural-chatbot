Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What did you do?  Albert?
Nothing. What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
'Good.'
