You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
Something bad happened tonight.
What?
I saw a man die.
What do you mean?
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
I'm sorry.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
