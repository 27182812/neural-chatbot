Evening. Table for one?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
I’m sorry...
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
