Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Yeah.  She told me.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I heard.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
You?
For calling you a homo.
That was out of line.
