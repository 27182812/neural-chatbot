Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Just ran into a little trouble.
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
No.
Hungry?
No.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
I had a problem getting my car back.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
