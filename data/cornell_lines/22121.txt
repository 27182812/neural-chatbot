My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
God.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Does it still hurt?
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
