Is there a reward in this?
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
You saw that?
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
