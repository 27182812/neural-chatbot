Waitaminute -
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
You can't do this -
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
Hang on there -
- and share one of your graves.
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
