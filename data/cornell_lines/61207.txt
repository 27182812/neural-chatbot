Get away!
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Yes!
You're using coconuts!
...What?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Where did you get the coconuts?
Through ... We found them.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
What do you mean?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
