What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
One last time.  It's important ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
