-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
He has Phil right now.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Yeah.
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
Do you wanna sit down?
I need to sit down.
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
