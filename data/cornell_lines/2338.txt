What time was it?
Huh?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Was it twelve o'clock?
