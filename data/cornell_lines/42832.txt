How are you feeling today?
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Just part of hospital routine.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Yes?
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Oh.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
I just say what the other person would say?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Good. What do you want?
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Fucking hell...
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Yes.
I was quite enjoying that.
Good. I'm glad
How many did I get right?
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
And when do I get out of here then?
I'm sure it won't be long now.
