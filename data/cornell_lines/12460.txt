Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
