Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
The place is pretty dusty.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Must be...
