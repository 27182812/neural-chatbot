Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
I still have one left...
You think so?...Selina?
You've seen me...
