We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
