Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Well what are we supposed to do?
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
