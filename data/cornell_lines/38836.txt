Why are you speaking?
Excuse me?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
I see.  How much?
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
