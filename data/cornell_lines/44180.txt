But you said you have the worst reputation.
I do.
Don't you want to change that?
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Same time next week?
No. This is going to be our last session.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
