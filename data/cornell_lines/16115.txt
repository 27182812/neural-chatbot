It is fifty years since I heard that name.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Where is he? My son.
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
