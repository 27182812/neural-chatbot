Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
