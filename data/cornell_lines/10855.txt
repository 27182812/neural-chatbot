Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
I will.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
