You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
