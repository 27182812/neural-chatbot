Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
What's that?
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
