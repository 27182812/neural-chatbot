Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
I had to quit, Midge.
Why?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
It wasn't your fault.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
It's where you belong.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Ah, Johnny-O...
