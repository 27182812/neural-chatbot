The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Convene?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
No. What had you better--?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
