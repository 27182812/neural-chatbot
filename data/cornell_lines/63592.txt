It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
I know the feeling.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You aren't?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Well.  Congratulations.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Are you asking me out?
