Is Jerry Delsano in?
Who's calling?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
The thing is...it really can't wait.
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
