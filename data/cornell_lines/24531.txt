You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Okay.
