Hi, want to take up dancing?
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Sure, they are students.
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
