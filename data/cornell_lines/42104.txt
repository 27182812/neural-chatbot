Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, how much would you like?
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I have?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
