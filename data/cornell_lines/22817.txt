What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
You better quit pushing me, pal.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
I'll do whatever I have to do.
