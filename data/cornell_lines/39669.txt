He's dead isn't he?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
He came to kill us.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You knew he was coming.
No.
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I didn't know this would happen.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Oh, Jesus...
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
But the police --
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- forget it --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
