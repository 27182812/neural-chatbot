Who's this?
My wife.
Where is the little lady?
In heaven.
She's dead?
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Auto wreck.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Died instantly?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes, they do.
