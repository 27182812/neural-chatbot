Will you stand still so I can do this!
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
In a bar called Hellfire.
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
What are the other reasons?
