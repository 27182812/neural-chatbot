We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
Okay great. What will that be?
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
What song?
"You Send Me."
Oh I know that. How does it go...
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
