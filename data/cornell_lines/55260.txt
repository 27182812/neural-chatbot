You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Never.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
That's not so.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
So you felt it too!
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
