Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
I find that unlikely.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
What say we turn up the heat?
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
