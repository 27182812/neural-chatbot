Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
You don't believe in it?
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
