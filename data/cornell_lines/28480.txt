There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
That's true.
Then there's the other issue.
What's that?
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
And nobody else can do that?
Not the way I can.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
I just need to go a little slow.
