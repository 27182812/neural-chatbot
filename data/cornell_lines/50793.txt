You really need that much?
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
God, you're serious, aren't you?
