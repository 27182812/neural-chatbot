Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Huh?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
No.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
