Who's that?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Great ass.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Yeah, I know.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
