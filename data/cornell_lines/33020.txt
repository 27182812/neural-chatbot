Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
I'm not sick.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
And you're unhappy.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Agnes...
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Sometimes, yes.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
