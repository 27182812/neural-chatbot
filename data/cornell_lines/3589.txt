It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
