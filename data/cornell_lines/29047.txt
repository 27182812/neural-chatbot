Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
You forgot "sexy".

Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Just what?
Kidding around... you know, fun.
