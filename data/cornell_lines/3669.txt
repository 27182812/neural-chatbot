No.
Have you had one?
Never.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not even that.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Not one.
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
How so?
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
