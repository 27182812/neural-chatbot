Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
