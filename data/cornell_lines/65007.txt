Good morning. Can I do something for you?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Bank?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
