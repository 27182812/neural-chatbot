I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
For dead bodies.
