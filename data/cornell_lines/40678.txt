Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
