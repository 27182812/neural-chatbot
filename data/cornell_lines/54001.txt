All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
How about the cop?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
