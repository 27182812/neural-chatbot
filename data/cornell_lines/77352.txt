Well?
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
How do we do that?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Somebody has to.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Then I'm a rich man.
