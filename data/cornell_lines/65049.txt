It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Mine?
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Mitchell was dead enough.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Magruder does.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Would I want to?
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
