-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.

But I have in India- every country presents problems.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
