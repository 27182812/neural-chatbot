Donut?
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I knew I could count on you.
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
