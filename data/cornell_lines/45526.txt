...I've missed you.						*
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
