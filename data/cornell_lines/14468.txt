Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Right.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
