Mrs. Lampert --
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Tell me what?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
I don't know anything.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Leave me alone -- !
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Stop it!
