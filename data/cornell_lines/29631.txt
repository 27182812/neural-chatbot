What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
He'll be there at 8:30.
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
