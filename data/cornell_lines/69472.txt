This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
No thanks.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
No thanks.
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
No thanks.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
... yeah.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Gee, this is great.
