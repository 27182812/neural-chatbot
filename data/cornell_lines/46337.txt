I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
There's still a sex-change --
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
