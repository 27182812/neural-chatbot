There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Don't get smart with me, son.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Thank you, Sir.
