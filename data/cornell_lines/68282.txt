What's that?
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You asked for shoe polish.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
Look it up.
