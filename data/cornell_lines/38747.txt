I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
