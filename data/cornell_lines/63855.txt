Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Where?
In there.
It frightens me.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Then..then what's that music?
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Something's making that music.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
