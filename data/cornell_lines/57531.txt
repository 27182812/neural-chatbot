Your father had been very sick.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Cow.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
Me. First break of day.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I pooped.
