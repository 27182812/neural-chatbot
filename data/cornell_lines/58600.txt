Hello?
Bob?
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?
Uh, no.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
It's just carpet.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Is there anything I can do?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
What?
You know, eat healthier.
Alright?
Not all that pasta.
Fine.
Like Japanese food.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Oh, come on.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
