And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
No.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
-- you could put it together --
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I was shot twice in the back.
Okay, so you're a victim.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
