Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
No.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
