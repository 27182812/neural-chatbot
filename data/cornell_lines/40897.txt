Frankie, I want to ask you something.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Of course, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Are you sure?
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Hm.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
He's good. He's fine.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
No problem.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
I understand.
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
