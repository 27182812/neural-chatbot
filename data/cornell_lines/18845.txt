Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Uh-huh . . .
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Me?
Uh-huh.
