Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
Yes.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
