My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Onions?
What?
You want onions?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
Sure.
