You're going to miss the train.
No, I'm not.
What are your plans in New York?
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I love the symphony.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
