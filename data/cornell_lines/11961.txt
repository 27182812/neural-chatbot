Great.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
You will keep in touch.
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
I will. See you.
