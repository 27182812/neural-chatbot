I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
What are you talkin' about?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
I'm out.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
