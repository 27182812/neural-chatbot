"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Well, except for the one girl.
What girl?
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
