You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers.
