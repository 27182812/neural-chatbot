Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
