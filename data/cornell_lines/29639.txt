The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Yes.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Yes -- of course.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
That can easily be arranged.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
