Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
