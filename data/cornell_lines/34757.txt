I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Yes, she is.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's a novel.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Yes.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
No.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Yes I did.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Don't I find what?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Not long.
Don't be silly.
Joking.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Do I put you off?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
And I you.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Ah.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
Mmm hmmm.
