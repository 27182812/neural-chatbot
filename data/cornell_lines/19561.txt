And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
I did not--
You've never *seen* this contract.
Never.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Looks like it, but--
But it *isn't*?
It couldn't be.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
