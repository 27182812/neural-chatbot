We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--

He didn't.
We believe he did.
You're wrong.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
Fuck you. You may have to what?
