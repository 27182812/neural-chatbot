Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
The cockpit? What is it?
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
