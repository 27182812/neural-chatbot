What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Yes.
Get out of here, Jack!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
A monster. I know, I know.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Jack, are you really dead?
What do you think?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
You must believe me.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
I will not accept this! Now go away!
