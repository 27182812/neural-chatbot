Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You tell me.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
