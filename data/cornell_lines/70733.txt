I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message.
What message?  What motorboat?
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Oh, he does!
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.
With ME?
That's right.
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
