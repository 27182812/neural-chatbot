Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
This conversation is finished.
You said we could go to New York.
Did not.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Get out.
No.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
