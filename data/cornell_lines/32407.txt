How are you -- is it Joe?
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.

I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
