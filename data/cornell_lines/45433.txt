Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
It don't matter!
What's that you say, Son?
I say -- it don't matter.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
