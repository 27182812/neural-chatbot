What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Your article sucked.
In what sense?
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm trying to help.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
