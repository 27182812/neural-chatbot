Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
I can believe that.
Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
What kind of people?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
Really?
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
What did you do?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
That's really something.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
The moon?
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
