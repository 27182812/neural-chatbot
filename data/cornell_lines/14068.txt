What do...
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
