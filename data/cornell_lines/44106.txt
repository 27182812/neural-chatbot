You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
What? Another letter from your friend?
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I sincerely doubt it.
Give me the fucking letter.
