The ropes are coming loose.
Be careful!
I am--It's our only chance.
Nothing is worth your life.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
You do?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You're talking nonsense.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I should hope not.  I hate you!
That sudden?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
...And I thought you loved me.
