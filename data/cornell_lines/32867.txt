Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
A little more so this time.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
But you just said that a month was too...
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
