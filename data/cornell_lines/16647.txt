A good day for singing...
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
