What do you want?
Came by to check on you.
After five years.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Look, I'm busy.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
No.
Good.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
You want me to fuck off?
Yeah.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
