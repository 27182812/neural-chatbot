That night?
Yeah.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
