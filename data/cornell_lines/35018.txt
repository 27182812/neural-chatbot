Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Naturally.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
I see.
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Don't mind what?
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Very clever.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
What do you mean, sorry?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
No key!
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
I dig.
So what's it going to be?
