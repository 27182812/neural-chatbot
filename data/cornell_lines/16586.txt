The princess is dead.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
