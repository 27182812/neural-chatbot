In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
How did you land that?
It came my way. 450 a week.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I had training. In the Republic.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
I start Monday week.
