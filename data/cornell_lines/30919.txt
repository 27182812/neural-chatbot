Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
What are you talking about?
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
