He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
None of your damn business.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
He's my subordinate!
