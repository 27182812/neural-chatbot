It will work out.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I understand.
You're an understandin' fella.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Okay.
