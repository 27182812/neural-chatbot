All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Thanks, Charlie.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Okay, Charlie.
