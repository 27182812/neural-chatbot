Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
She'll be back...
