Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
