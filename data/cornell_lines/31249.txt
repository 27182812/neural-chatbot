Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Mars.
Right.  Mars.
That a problem?
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
