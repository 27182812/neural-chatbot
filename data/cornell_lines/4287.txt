Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
You need money again?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
