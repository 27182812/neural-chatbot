John, throw me the keys.
What for?
The trunk.  It's locked.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
It's . . . it's locked.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
No.  I swear it.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
