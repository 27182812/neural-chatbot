There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Carrots.
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
I hate the horrid stuff.
