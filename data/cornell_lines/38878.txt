Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
