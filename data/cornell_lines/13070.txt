James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
How good is he?
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
