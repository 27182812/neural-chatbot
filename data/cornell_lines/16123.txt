Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
No?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
