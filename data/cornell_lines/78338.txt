You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Maybe I can get down there next week.
