This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
No shit! He's good!
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
