But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...

Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
You could give up.
