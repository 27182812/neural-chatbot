...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Excellent picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
