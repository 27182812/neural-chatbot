Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Until the old man tells me different.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
