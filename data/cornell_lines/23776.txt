Read some good books.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
I'll send you some comic books.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Like what?
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
