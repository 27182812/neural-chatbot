Theo, Buzz is dead.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
