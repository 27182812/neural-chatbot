You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
What's to be jealous of?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous person.  Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.
