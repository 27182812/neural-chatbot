What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
