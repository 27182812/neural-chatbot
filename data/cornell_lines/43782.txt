Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
He missed three weeks.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
But you were there?
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
