I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
I've met someone else.
Who?

Have you been seeing another teacher?
No.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
He's a patient here.
