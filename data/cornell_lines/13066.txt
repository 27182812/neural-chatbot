Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Whaddya been so far?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
What's that supposed to mean?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
I told you. I got drunk.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Thanks for the drink.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
To do what?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Why?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
For me.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
You think I can lose?
I never saw you do anything else.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
Kiss off.
