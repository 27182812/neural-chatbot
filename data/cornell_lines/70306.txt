You know what, by God?
What?
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Please Doyle, don't.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
