Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
White-walls?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
A half-track, anything.
Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
