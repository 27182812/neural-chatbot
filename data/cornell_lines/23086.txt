Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Well, sir, I putter.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Well sir, I'll show you.
