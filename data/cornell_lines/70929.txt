What’s going on with you two?
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Mom, please.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
She did?
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
