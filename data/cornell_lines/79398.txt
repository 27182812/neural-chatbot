We need gas.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot!  Who shot you?
It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
