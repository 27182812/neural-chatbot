...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Are you sad, Bill?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
Of course.
