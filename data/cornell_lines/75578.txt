I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
What then?
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
