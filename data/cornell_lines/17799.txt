Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
How could it not?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Come on now.  People are smart.
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
