I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
What the hell is this?
The freeway.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
