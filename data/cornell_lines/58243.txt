Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
No, sir--
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
I'm sorry, sir.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Yes, sir--
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?
The--the officers.
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
