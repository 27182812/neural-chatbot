May I please see the storage facility?
Why do you want to see it?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
