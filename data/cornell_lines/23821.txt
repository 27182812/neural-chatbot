It is something really important, Jeff?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Who's Thorwald?
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Goodnight, you idiot.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
