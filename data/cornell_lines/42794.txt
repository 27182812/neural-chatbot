Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
Great, sir. Great.
Try the wine!
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Won't you join me, sir?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
And you, sir?
