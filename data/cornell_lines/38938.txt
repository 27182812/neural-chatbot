There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
What?
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
