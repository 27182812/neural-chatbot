Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
No! What gave you that idea?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
