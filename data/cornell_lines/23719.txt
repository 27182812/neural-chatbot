Where you been all day?
I took the kids to my sister's.
I called. You weren't there.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
"Father of the Bride."
What was it about?
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What're you talking about?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I am answering...
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
