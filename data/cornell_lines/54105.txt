Is my daddy okay?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I think so.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Okay.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
He has lots of disks.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
