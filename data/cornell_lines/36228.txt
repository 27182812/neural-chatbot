Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
No.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Holly.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
What for?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
