I don't see no sign of guts in you.
No. No chains either.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
You phony creep!
