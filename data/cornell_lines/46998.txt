Good morning!
Could I trouble you for some water?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
I see.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Do you have your papers, sir?
What?
If I could just see some identification.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
