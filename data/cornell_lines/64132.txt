He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Red...Strange?
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
How would I know.
