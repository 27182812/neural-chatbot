Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
