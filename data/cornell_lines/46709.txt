Whose shoe?
Susan Lefferts.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
