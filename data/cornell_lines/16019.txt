No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Yes.
He has come for Lyssa.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Can she be forced?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Never.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
Yes.
