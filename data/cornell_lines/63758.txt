Now what are you doing?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
What made you want to be a fighter?
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
Terry!
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
Why, Terry, who said it was?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
His— racket?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
But a priest...?
