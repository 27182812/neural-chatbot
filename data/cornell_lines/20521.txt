Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Certainly.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
Why not?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What are you talking about?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
That's all I can say.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
