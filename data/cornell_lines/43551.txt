Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Are we imagining it?
