Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.

Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
