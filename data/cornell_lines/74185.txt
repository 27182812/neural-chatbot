Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Yes.
Why did you do that, Billy?
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
