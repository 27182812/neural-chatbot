Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
Thanks.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
That's right.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.

It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
What?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Why?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
What's on your mind?
Five G's—or I crab the works.
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
