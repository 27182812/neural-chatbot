We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
There is?
Something's on.
What?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
You do?
You bet.
Like what.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't get it.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
What's in it?
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
How we gonna get that lucky?
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
