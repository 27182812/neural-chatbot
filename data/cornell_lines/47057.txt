Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
Are you crazy?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Because I'm a nurse.
