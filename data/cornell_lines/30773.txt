We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
An invasion...
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
