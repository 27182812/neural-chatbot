If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Then why did you take this job?
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Afford it?
Have you ever been with a male band?
Me?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Rough?
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Bingo?
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Really?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
That so?
Every time!
You know - I play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Yeah.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Yeah.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
You don't say?
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Men!
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Brains aren't everything.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
