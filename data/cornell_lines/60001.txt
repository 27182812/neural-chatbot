Don' need you okayin'.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
