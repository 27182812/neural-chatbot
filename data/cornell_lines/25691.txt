Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
