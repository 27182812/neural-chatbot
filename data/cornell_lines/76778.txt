Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
