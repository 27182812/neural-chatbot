Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Maybe the Feds got it.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
