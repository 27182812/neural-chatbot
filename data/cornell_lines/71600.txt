Do you talk with your mom?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
So why do you stay?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
