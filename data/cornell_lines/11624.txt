Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Yes.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
But this is my car.
Your hearse?
Yearse!
Oh.
