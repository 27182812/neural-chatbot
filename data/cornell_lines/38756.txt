You want to tell me about it?
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
