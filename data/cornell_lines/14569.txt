Hi.
Tough day.
My sympathies.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
It's going to get worse, honey.
