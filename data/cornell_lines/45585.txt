What the fuck do you want?
They were ...
You tryin' to fuck me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Yeah ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
You're full of shit ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Well, what were you doin' back there?
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Don't fuck with me ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
What else?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Okay ...
