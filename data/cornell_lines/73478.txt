It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
Who?
The other guests?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
