Here.  Finish the job.
I'm utterly satisfied.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
I'm going to shoot you now.
No!
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
If you want to be found that way.
What is this thing that kills me?
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Don't shoot.
I've enjoyed being man.
