Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
May I come in?
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I don't believe you have "things."
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
