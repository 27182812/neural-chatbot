We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.

What do you do far a living?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.

To see pap.

I'd say you're already enjoying some.
