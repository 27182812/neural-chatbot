I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
You sat and talked until it was light...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
