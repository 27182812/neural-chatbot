Were you attracted to me right away?
No.
When did it start?
Honestly?
Uh-huh.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Why?
That doesn't sound normal.
I'm not normal.
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
