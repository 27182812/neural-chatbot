You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
You know something about me?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Water?
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
