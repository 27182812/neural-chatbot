What did you say?
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Not funny, Sam!
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
But, Mom...
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
No, I'm not...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
