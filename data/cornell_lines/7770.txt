Do you hear it? Right there.
Hear what?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
