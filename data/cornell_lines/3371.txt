Yeah. Big fan.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No need to be modest, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
I have a job.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
