So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Why?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
So now you hate all women?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
