Oh, how beautiful!
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
I shall wear it in my hair!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Oh, please!
