Rich...
Good morning, Walt.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Richard Travers.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Appreciate it.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
