Where'd you come from?
San Diego.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Sorry.
'S okay. What do you think?
Huh?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Aw, too bad.
