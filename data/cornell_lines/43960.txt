You, sister...
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
They forced me to marry!
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
You know about Lo?
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Where is he now?
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
