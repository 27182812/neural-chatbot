Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't have to say that.
