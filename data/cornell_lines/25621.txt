I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I'm not --  He's not.
