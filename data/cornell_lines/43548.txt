I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.
