Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Some.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Can I ask you a question?
Anything.
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
Yeah.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
Yeah.
