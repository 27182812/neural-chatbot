C'mon.  I want to know.
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
What's the difference?
You know the difference.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
