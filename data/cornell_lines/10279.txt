Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
