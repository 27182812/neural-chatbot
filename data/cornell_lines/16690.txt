Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
How do I get the horn back?
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Not very precise directions.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Is she fair, this princess?
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
She's dead!
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
I don't believe you.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
