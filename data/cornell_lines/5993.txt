Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Don't even start.
