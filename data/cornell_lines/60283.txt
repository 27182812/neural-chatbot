It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
Who?
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
