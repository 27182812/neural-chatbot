I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
MURDERED?!!
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
