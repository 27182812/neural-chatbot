I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
