I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
I'm not made of glass.
I just want to sit here and be still.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
Talk about what?
The talk is everywhere!
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
