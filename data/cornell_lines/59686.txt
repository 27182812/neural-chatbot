So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
The beginning?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
And she's never wrong.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
She helped you?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
