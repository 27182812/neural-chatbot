I'm on the run!
What's happened?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
