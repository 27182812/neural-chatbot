I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
What?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Any time.
