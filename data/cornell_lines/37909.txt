Stay in him forever?
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
