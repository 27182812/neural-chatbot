Interesting business.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
You don't have to do it for a living.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
And you like it.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
