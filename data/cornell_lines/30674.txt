Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Oh... are you... ?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
