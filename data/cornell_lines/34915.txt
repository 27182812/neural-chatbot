Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
