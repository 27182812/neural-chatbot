But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Signs?
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
