I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
Do you know how they were damaged?
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
Fail-safe?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
