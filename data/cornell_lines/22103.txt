Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Seriously.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Really?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
