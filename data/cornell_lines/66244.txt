You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
