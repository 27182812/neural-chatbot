You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
For a movie?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
What's it called?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
