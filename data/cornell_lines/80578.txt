Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Don't even.
Do you love me?
What?
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
What are you talking about?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Who's dead?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
It's too late.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
But...
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
But...
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
