Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
I know that.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Same here.
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
