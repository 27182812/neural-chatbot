The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
