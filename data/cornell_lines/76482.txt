What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Then why aren’t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
