So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
I didn't mean it that way.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
