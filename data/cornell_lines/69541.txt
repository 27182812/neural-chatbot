Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
Wanda...
Oh yeah?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Yeah?...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
I'm busy, man.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
