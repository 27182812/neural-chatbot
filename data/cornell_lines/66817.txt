Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
