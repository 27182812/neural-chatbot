Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
I'm getting paid...
...peanuts.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
