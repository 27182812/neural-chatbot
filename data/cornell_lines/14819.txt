You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Were you a disco girl?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
So where did you go?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
