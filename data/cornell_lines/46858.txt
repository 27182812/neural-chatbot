Do you see anything you like?
I'm married.
That's fine.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Can you help me?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
Very good.
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
It's a little late for that.
I'll say.
What size?
Pardon?
What size?
Eight.  Size eight.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
Remain calm.
Okay.
