Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Sure you can.
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
