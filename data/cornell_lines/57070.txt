That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
None of that's true?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
