Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Do you really think that?
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Wouldn't profit him none.
