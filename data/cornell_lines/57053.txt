Three.  Where's my client?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.

Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
