I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
Give me an example.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
It's possible.
Including the death of your husband?
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
