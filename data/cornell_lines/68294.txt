What are you doing?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
