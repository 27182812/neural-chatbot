It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Okay.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Okay, okay.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
I don't need one.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
No, you don't.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
