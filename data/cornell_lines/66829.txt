Juliet!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
[Within] Juliet!
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
