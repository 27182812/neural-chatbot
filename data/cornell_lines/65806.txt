In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
