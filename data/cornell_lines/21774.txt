Sure you don't want any salad?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
