Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
