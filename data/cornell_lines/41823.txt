Fuck!

Oh, shit.
Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...Shift.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy!
I think...
...we can make it.
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!

Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
...do we?
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!


Oh, shit.
Okay.
Okay.
