Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
No.  Just no.
You prefer women?
No.
Well then...?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Sad? What made you sad?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
You felt sad. What's your name?
Jessica.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
Later.
No.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I thought I had to do something.
And?
I changed my mind.
And now?
Curious.
About what?
How a Sandman lives.
