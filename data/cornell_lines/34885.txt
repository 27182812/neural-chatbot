Barbatus!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
