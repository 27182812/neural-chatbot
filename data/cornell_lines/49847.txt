A .357.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
