Who are you?
You called me by my name.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where do you come from?
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
But where is that?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
