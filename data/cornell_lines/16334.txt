Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
