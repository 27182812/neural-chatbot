...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
