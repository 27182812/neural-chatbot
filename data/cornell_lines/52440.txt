So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
When are you coming home?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Okay.
