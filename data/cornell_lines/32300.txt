I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Told you not to call your mama.
