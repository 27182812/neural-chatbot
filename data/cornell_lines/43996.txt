Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Shu Lien...
Save your strength.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
