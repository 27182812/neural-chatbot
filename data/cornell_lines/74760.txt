It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...

What?
Scams, con games.  How many?
I don't know.  A lot.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
