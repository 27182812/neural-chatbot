It's a tradition.
I know, Dad.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You went berserk...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did your father...
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I must only let the red rage...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
