I thought you and George were getting married.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
I wish I only had your problems.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
