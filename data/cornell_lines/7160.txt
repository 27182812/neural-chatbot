That's even a greater honor.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
$50?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
