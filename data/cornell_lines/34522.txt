Hey, listen, listen.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
Really?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Yeah.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Oh, all right.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
