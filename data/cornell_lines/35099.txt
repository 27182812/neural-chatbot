Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
