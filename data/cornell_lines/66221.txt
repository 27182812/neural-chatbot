I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
Gonorrhea?
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
