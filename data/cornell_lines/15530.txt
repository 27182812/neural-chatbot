God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Hot!
