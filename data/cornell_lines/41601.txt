Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
How much is it worth?
The money is unimportant.
I'm afraid it is important.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
What's its value today?
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
In money.
Forty-five thousand.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
And the last one?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Here's ten.
