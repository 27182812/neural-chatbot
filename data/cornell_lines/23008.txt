Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Quite so. Quite.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
