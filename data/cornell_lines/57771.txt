Hey.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
I want you to go there.
