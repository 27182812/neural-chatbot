Funny couple, ain't they?
Yeah.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Yeah?
What do you reckon that's for?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
A trumpet?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
I dunno.
