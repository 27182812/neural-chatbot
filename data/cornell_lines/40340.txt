Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
You didn't like them.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Would you sleep with them?
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
