Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What's he up to?
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
What's the matter, chérie?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
What?
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
