So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
I'm not even good for me.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Let me jingle you right now.
