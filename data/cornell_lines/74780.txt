You look good.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
About me?
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Never better.
Elizabeth?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
I redecorated.  What about you?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
Yeah.
You need anything?
No.
Really?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
