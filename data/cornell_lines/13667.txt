Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Me? What'd I do?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
I don't know what you're talking about.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
No.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
Then how'd I get here?
