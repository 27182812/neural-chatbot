Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Thank you.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Yes... you will wait.
