I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
But why?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
