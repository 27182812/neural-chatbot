I warned you a million times.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
