Give me this fucking thing.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
What do you care?
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Give me my book.
You gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
