He'll need clothes... some money...
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
