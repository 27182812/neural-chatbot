When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
You mean Tattaglia.
Barzini.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
