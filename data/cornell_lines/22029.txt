How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
I been calling for four months.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
