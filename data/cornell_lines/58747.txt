She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Parents died?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
What happened?
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
She told me she killed them.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
