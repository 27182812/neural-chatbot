He told you.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.

I want to give you something. Will you let me?

Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Okay.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
