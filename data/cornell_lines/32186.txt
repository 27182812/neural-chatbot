Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
You black?
No.
You an indian?
No.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Ready for another?
Why not?
