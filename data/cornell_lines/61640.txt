So where does this lead ?
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
So what do we do ?
I'm working on it.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
First Bank ? But how ?
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
McCay knows ?
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
