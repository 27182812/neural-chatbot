Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
And the seas would boil ...
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
