Thank you.
How about it?
What happened, Duff?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Don't push me, Duff.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
What about that girl?
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
No. But a small one.
