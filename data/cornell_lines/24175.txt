I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Mr. Bangs.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
