You got a suitcase?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Where are you going?
To get my car.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
