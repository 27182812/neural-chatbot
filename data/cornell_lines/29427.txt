I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
You said three o'clock.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
And he'll talk?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Yes.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
