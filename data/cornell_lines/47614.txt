Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Never heard of that system.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
A mining colony.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
Can you trust him?
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
