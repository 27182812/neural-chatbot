Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
The theatre?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, of course.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
