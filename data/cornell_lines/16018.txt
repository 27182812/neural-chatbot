The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
<u>Why</u>?
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
You will know, in good time.
