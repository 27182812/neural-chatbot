-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
Nykwana Wombosi.
What is that?
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
I don't know.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
Go back to the hotel.
