Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
He's feeling wonderful.
Thanks be to God.
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Buying her?
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
I understand.  How much?
