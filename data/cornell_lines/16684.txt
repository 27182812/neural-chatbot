What's the matter?
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Pinching?  Where?
Everywhere!  Ow!
I can't see a thing.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
