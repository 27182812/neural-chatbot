You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
That's right.
