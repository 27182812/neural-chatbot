Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
I already made an appointment for later today.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
