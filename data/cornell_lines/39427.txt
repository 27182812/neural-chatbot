You boys been hitting the pipe?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
It was just like in my head.
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
