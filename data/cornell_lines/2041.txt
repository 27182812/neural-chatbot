What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
What is what?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Mozart -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
