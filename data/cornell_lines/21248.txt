Are we going to build our little house?
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
