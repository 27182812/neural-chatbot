Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
This has to be a big mistake.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
