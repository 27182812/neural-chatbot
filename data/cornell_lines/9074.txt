So why are you telling me this?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
