I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Well, what do you know about that!
Found in Asia!
Uh-huh.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Not at all.
