You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I thought this was your dream come true.
That's not why he's sending me.
Why then.
Because it looks good.
