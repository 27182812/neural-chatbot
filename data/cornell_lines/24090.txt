He'll kill you.
You're not hearing me here --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
Nick, please, it's me --
You told him about Nick's letters.
No, Nick, no --
You're in on this.
I love you!
