Six thousand, right?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
