The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
But is she, has...
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
What are you doing?
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
