What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
No, you're his wife.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
It don't look right.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
And you're drinking with them right now.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
