I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
I know that.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
