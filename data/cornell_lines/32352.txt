Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
By who?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
You heard right.
You really are one dumb asshole.
Life is unpredictable.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I didn't see nothin'...
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
I know... I remember.
Well?...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Thanks...
