Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Do tell.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
I don't think so.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
