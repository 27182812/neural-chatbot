Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
It was a powerful air.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.
