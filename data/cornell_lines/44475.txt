What?
I really gotta pee.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
I didn't have to pee then.
My apartment's just such a mess.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.
Yes I do have to pee!
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Uh huh. So pee.
So pee? Here?
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
