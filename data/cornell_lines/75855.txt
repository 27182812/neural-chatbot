Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Richard. Hi.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Just five dollars, please.
