What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
What's this about, money?
It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
