I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I know you will.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this.
