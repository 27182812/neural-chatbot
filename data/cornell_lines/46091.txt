Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
We start our own class?
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
