This has been a good year.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
You've killed your fair share of men.
If I could go back to farming --
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
We're doing this for Ma.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
