Yeah?
That's no way to answer the phone.
Is that you, Dean?
Sure is.
What can I do for you?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
