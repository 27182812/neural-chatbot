Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
