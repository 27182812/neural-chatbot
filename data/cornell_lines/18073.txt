Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
No.
Brooklyn.
Yeah?
He must have that shit troughed.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
