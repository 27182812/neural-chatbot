Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Sure.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Alexander.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
There -- you're a new man.
