The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
But Chief?  Over this??
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
