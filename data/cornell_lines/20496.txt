You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
Yes, I am, sir.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Do you have three francs, sir?
