Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Really?
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
