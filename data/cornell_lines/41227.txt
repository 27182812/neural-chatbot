I'm here.  Where are you?
We don't see you.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
Stay there.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
It's your call.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
Just relax.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
You'll see her.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Talk to the man.
