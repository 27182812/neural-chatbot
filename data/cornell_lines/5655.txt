Are you okay?
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Like how?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I walk differently?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
