So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
