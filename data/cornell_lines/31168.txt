What the fuck is going on down there?!
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
