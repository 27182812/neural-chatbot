She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Don't you have a maid?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Pupils?
Yes.
Yes.
How many?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
This one will.
