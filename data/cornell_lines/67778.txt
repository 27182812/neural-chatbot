Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.

Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
