Don't bother.
What?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
I was just waiting for the right time.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
Carl, that's insane.
So my wife is lying?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
