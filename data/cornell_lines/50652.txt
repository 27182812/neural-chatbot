Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
I was educated by nuns.
Yes.
I have excellent long-term memory.
Yes.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
Yes, Peter.

What color?
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Burnt sienna.
Mine was cobalt blue.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Yes.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Yes.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
