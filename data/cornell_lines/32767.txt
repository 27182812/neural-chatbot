Need some help?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
What about O-2?
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
