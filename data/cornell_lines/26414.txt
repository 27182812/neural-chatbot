Mike?
What?
My ass if falling.
Your what...?
My ass is falling.  It is.
What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
