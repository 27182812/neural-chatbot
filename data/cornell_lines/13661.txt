No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What is your name?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
I just got here.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
What street?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah?
Shut up!
