Yah!
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yah.
My patience is at an end.
Yah.
Good day, sir.
...Yah.
