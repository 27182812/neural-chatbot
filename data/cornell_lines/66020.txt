I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
You're insane.
Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done.
