Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
You bet I do, sir.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
