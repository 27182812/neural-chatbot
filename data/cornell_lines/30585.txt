So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
Uh-huh.
Any idea where I might start looking?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
All you want is a phone number?
Well, I know you're busy...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
I don't buy it.
You don't buy what?
