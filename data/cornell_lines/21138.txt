Good evening, Your Highness.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Count d'Algout...
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
