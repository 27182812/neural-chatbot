It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Tell me all about her.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
How early?
Very early. Dawn.
Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
No.
Or arrived with her.
No.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
No.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
No! Of all...
How do you know she didn't make a call?
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Back where?
What do you mean?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
How did she pay you?
What?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Cash.
And when she left, she never came back.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
She isn't still here, is she?
Not at all!
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
