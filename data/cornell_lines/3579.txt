That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
