Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
What were you -- a child actress?
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Second generation, huh?
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Nice job.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
If you please.
