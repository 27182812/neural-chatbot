I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Yes.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
