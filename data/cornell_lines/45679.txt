What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
Oh my God, mother!
I said you were never a faggot.
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
We can't stay here.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
