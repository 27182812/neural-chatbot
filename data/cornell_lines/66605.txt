Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
