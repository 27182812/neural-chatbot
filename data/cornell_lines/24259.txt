Let's go over it. Where are you?
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
