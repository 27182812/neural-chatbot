That dam is a con job.
What dam?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
The Valley?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
No.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Know him?
No, I think I'd remember.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
And Hollis knew about it?
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
