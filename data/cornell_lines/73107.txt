You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Yeah.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Intense.
How long were you in there?
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
