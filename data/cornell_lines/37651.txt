Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Yes. I was.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Of course.
