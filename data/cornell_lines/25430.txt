For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
