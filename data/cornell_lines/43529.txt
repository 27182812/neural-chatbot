See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
