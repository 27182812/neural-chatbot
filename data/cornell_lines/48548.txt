Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Not by a long shot.
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
