Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
I know. I could have picked you up.
Huh?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
