I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
I got pain an' experience too.
Please, kid.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
