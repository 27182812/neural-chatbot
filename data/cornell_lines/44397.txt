I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
