Oh.  Sorry.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Put your head back.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
