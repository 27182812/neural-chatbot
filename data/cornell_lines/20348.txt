I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
You're nuts.
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
Against.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
