Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Why?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
