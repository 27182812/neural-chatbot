What happened to your big "assignment"?
What do you know about it?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Have fun at work.
