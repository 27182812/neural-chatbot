You're leaving, aren't you?
I have to...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
No. It's a lot further than that.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
No... I'm from France.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
That's impossible.
Why?
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
