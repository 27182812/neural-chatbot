What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
We can't. We're going back.
To what?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Things change!
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
