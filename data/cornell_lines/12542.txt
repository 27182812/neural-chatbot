All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
What?
Shoot to kill, I said.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
