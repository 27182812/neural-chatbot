I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
No.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
