What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
What brings you to Sierra?
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Where you headed?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Live there?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
Wait a second--
Ah, I can smell it on you.
