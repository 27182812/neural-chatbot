Yeah?
It's me.
Frank?
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
It's not family.  It's business.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
We don't get a gig.
What're you talking about?
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
