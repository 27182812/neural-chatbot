I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
