The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
No.
Why?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
There is one.
Who?!
You.
Me?
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
To me? But why?
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
