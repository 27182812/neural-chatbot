I know this.
I love you.
I'm listening.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Mookie's OK.
You listening to me?
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
How do you know this?
I know.
You really think so?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
So what do you want me to do?
