Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Yes... leaving immediately.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
I don't understand.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
I will do my best.
