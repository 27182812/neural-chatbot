Goodbye...
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Divine ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
But it could have been glorious.
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Goodbye ...
