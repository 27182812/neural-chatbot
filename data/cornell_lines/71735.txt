Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Because when we get down there --
Wait -- down where?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Underwater?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
It never occurred to me.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
What -- are you threatening me?
