Here.  Ti amo.
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Again?
Yeah.
You did this once it didn't work out.
The guy died.
What killed him?
He got hit by a bus.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Johnny Cammareri.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
In a month.
I won't come.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
I didn't give you away the first time.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Maybe.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
He did?
Yeah.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
