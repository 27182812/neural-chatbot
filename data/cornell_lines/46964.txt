Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
