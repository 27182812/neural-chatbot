Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
What?
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
For Africa.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
You invited me.
To make an ass of yourself.
What went wrong?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Gee whiz--
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You're hollow, like a woman.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
You're my buddy.
Out!  Out!
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Out!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Thank God!
