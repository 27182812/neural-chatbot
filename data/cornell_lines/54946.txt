And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
