What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
