You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Perhaps.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
