Qual se tu?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
With a starship!
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
It could. Yes.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
It will be your chariot!
