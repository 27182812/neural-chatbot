It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Yes.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
