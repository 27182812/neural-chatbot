Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Did she have someone with her?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Was there an argument?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now.
