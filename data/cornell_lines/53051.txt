Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
He's fine.
Yeah?
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Oh!
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I think so.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Yeah.
The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?
