I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
-- it was a betrayal.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
So what happened?
I told you.  Nothing --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
