You been okay?
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
How's Estelle?
Fatter... some things never change.
Boring.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
No. It's been a long time.
