This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
... Fascinating.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
It's a little early to celebrate.
