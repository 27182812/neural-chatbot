Why should it be grounded?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Have you tried the telephone?
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
No.
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
