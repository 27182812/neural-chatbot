Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
You're more than modest.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Please do.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
It needn't be.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I am somebody.
