Wow. You look beautiful.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you’re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you’ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn’t outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn’t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don’t know, but your misery just isn’t working for me anymore.
