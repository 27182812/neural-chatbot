When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Kay, I told you...
Goodbye, Michael.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Michael.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
You haven't heard me.
