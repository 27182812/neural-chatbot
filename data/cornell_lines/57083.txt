I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
Not yet.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
Great.	When can you do it?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
You're not going to be there?
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
