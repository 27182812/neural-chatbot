How come you don't hate their guts?
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
