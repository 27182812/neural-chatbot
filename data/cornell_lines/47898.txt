You're convinced that it's genuine.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
I see, your excellency.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Thank you your excellency.
