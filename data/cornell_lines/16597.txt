Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
The colt's still too small.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Aye!  That too.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
