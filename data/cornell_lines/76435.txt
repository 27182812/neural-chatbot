A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
Like you’ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
