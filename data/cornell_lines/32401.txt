Naturally you have copies.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
That was MacCaulay.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
