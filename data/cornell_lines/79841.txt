Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
What's he look like?
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
