Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
All the time...
Well, you are.
