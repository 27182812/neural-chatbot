What did I say?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
I need your truck.

No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...and a shitload of ice.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...-tana.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...ya?
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
And if that Elvis shit...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible.
Peace.
All right.

Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You want cash?
You want cash?
I got, like, uh....
I got, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
No.
All right, then how about this?
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
...doing?!
I need your truck!
You are not takin' my truck!
