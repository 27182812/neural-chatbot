In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Your Excellency!
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
