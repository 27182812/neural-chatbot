The Navy Cross...
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Just a coincidence?
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
