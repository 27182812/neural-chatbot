Is it them?
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Are they going to kill you?
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
What are you going to do?
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
