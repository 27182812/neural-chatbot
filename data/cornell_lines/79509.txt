My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
