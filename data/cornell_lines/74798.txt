I need your car, Elizabeth.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
