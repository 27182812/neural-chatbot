Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
What'll it be?
Fill 'er up.
You got it.
I haven't got it yet.
