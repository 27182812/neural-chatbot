Huh?
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Excuse me?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?
You mean coitus?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Oh, no.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Take a look at this, sir.
