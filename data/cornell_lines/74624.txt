Dr. Furtwängler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
