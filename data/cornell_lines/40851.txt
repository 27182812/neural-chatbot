When I left here with the money...
Mm.
...I got muscled on the street.
Mm.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
