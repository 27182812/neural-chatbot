It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
At least you were outside.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Bullshit.
I mean it.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
... and live happily ever after.
