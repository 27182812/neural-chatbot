...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
