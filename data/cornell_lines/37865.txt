No.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Two hundred dollars, please.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
