Christ, I know how it sounds.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
I don't know what to say.
I need your insight, your intuition.
