Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Galley proof.
Galley what?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
