People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Really.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
So how does it happen?
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
