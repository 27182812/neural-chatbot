I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Cut.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Too slow?
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Was he really upset when you told him?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
What for?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
You are?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
