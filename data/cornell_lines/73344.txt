Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
She thinks you went to the police.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
