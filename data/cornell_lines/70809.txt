I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
We can have it altered.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Why not?
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
It doesn't matter.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
I don't care.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
I forgive you.
And I can never have children.
We'll adopt some.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Well - nobody's perfect.
