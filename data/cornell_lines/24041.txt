He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Do you think your father means that?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
That one?
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
No.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
