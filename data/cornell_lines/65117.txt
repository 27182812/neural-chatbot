One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
With what motive?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
