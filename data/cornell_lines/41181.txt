I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Not a chance.
Don't say that.
Do you know what's in that box?
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
