Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
What's this?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
In what way, pray tell?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Maybe it's time you got out.
Me?
You.
Okay.  Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so.  It could have been.
If what?
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
