[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Yes.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I know.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
