Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Anything.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Why? What for?
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
