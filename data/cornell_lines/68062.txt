Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Ours is not to reason why.
Huh?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
