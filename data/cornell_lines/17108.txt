Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
