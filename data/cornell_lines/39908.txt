My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
The ghosts--
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
I think the worst is over.
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here.
