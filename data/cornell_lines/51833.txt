So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
Where's the stuff?
What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Oh no! No!  Noooo!
