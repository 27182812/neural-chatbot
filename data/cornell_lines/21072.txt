No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Well, a hat...
What was it like?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.
Evening gown?
A dress you wear in the evening.
What do you wear in the morning?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
And there?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
You feel it, though.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
What is it, Anna?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You want this?
Just for the honeymoon.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
