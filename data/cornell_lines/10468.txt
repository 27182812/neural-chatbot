There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I think I should spend the night here.
That's it.  Get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
Out!
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
Don't scream.
Then leave.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
All right.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Goodbye.
No kiss?
