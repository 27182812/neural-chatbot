God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
How?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
