How come?
The doctor suggested it.
What doctor?
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
Uh-huh?
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
