Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
