If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
Where is she?
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Where'd she go?
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
