Excuse me, Sir...?
Yes?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
