They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
You will follow me.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
