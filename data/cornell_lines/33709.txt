Don't run away, Bill.
From what would I be running?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
I'm for it.

Your make-up's a little heavy.
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.

I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
You hear all kinds of things.

Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
