Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
But I've seen him!
You've been watching too much TV.
He says things.  Bad things.
Like what?
