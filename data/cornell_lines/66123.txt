The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
That's what she would say herself.
A wonderful woman, boy.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
No, son, she is dead.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
