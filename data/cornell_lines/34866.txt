So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
