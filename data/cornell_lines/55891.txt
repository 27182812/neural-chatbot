Where the hell is Air One?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Did he raise the Kids?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Yeah?  Then what?
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Did you say Cable Junction?
That's what he said.
When?
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
