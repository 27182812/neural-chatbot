You got the job?!!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Better than not getting a job?
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
No!  A horror movie star!
Boris Karloff!?
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
You met Basil Rathbone!
