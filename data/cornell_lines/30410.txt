I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
