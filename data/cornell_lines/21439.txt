I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.
