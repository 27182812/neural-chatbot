Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Mr. Holland?
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
