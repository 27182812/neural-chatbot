What is that?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
What, like a girdle?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
That's the spirit!
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Really?
Never...
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Oh yeah?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Why?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
