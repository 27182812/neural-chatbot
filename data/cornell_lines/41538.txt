I believe you.
Thanks very much.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
But --
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
