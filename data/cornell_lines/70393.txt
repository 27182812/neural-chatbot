Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
