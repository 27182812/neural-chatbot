Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
I don't know.
