You know what I think about, Talby?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
