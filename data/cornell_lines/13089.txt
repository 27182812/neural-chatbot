Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Half.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Well, here it's half.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
