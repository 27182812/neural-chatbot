You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
