Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake?
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
