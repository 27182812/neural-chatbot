See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
I leave it to you.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Twinky?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
A wig?
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
