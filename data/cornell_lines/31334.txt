What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
I'll call that little bluff.  How close?
