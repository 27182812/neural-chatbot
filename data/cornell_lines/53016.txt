Like what?
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Why?
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
No.
Oh, yes, you have!
No.
You've been with someone!
Stop accusing me!
