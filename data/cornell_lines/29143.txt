This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Thanks, I like it.  I think.
