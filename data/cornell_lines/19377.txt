Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Who?
Tommy Reina.
