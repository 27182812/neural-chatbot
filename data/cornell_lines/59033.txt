You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
I went out last night.
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
No.
You on any medication?
No.
Been drinkin' today?
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
