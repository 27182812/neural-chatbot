Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
You're going.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
You're going.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Bon voyage.
You're not listening to me.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
