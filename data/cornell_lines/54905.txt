They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
The West Indies?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
But it's so far away...
That's rather nice, isn't it?
