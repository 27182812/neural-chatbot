So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Don't you like this?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Good-looking woman.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Well, there's Lily.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Amazing.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
