Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
There must be something...
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
