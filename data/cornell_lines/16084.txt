One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
