Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
I guess it must.
What do you do anyway?
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
Come here.
