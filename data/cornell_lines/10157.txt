Wow!  What was that all about?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
How can you be so sure?
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
