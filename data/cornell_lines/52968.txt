It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
