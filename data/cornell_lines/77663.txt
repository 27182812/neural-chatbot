Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
What time is your rendezvous?
Now, Lily--
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Lily, you must listen to me.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
But, Lily--
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
