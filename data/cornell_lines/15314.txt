What's that?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
What? What?!
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
How can you tell?
Florida license plate.
He ate a car?
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
