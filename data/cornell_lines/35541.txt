Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
What?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.
We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
