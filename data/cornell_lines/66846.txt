Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
I thought all for the best.
A Plague o' both your houses.
NO! Mercutio!
