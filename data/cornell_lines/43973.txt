No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Give me back my comb.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Give it back.
