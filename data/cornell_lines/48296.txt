... I was dreaming ...
Something good?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Must've been after we got engaged.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
So you had a nightmare.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Were you there to catch me?
No.
How come?
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
