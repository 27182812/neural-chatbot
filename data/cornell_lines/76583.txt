Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
I tried to.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I don't remember.  Maybe.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
I don't know...
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
