Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
What do you want to know that for?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Call me Sonny-boy.
Sonny-boy, one word?
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Call me whatever you want.
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
I frisk you?
You frisk me.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Okay, give us the women.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
