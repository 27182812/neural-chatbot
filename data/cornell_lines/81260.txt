She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
How do you know it's a she?
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
What does she look like?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Fine.
What do you think I should do?
