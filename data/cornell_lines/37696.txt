Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
