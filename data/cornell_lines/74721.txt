I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
A game?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
I'm sorry, about this...
You should be.
