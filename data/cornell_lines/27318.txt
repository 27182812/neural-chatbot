Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
