You packing up tonight?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.
London.  That's a promotion!
I don't think so.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Hold it down, okay?
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
