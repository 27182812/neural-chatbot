Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
It was open.
You got a lotta nerve.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Bent?
Bent.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
How do I know you didn't?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
That would be appropriate, yes.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
