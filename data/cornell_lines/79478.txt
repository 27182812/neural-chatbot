Look, I just want to pick up my car.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
How much?
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
How much!?
Hundred-fifty.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
