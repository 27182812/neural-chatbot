How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
