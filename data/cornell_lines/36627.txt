Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
