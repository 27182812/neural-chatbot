Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
I think you could have.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
