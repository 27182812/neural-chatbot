Your Highness...
Yes, General Savitzky?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
