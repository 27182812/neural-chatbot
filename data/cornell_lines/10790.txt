I got a single room.
That's fine.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Benjamin.
Yes?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
To tell you?
Yes.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
The number.
What?
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
