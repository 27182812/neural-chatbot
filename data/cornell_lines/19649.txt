Mr. President--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
