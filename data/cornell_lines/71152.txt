Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
I wanta see Nathan.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Will they give him a trial?
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
