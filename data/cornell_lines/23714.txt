Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
What?
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah, what?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
What did I say?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Positive.
You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
