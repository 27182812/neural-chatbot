I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
And what is that?
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
