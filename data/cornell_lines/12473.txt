The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
