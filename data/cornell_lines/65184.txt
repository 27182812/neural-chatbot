I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Yes.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
