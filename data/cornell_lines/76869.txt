You're late.  Where you been?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
All of it.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
I think it's the best...
