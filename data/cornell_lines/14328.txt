Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Any others?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
What do they say?
They're practically all the same, sir.
Amateurs!
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
