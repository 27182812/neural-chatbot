I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Then you yield to me.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
That is a trifle strong.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
