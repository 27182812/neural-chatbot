It's the lights. And the scotch.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
Around.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
Do you always ask so many questions?
No, not always.
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
