Are these your bags?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Okay, doll.
I suppose you want a tip?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Bye.
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Why?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Wanna see my driver's license?
Get lost, will you?
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.
