What do you think I am -- a crook?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
