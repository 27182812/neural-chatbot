Repeat that, Bill.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Where is he now?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Did you ask him who he is?
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
