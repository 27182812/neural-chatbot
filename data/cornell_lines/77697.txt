Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Well--uh--yes and no.
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
Right!
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Very well, madame. Thank you.
