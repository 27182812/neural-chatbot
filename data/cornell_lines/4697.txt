Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
