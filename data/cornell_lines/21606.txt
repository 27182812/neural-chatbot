Wasn't no bullet?
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
No sir.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Well I don't either!
