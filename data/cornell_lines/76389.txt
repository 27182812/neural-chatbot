How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.

Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
No. You’re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
