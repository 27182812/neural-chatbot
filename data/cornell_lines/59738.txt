You don't have...
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
Zion?
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
It's a city?
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Where is it?
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
