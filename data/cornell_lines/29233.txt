Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
What.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
The G-man?
Zackly.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
