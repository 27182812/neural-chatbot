Don't you ever have any problems?
I have one now.

Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Homework. It's more interesting.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Nothing, thank heaven.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
