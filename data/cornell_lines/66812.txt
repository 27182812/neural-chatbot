What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Young Romeo is it?
'Tis he.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
I'll not endure him.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
