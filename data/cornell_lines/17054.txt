You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
