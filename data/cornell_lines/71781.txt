How do you feel about snakes?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You know what I mean.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
You tell me.
Do you fear them?
Don't you?
Are you manifesting them?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Did you?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
You think I manifested the snakes?
Someone did.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
