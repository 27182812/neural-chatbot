Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
