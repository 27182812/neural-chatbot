I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Like you don't know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
