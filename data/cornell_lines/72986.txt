Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect...
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
What about the President?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
So what?
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
