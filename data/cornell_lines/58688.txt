Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
What's that got to do with you?
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I do.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
I'll bet.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
