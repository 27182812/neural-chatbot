I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
I feel so embarrassed.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
But I... We don't even know each other.
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
