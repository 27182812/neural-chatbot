You called, Doctor?
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
How come?
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
And what else is bothering you?
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
It's his work.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Not enough loving.
Get out of here!
