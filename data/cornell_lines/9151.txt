So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
Most people don't.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
