Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Say that again.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
