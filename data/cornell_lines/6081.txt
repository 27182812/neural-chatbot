He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
I'm *not* a doctor!
I'm sorry, Homer.
