Did you suggest any?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
What did she say?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
-- And what did you suggest?
Cocaine.
