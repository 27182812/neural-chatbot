At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
You don't understand this guy.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm not running.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
