Got it.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
How?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
