I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
