Thank you again. Good-night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Don't go.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No.
No? Then what?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Yes.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
No.
That's not very complimentary, either.
