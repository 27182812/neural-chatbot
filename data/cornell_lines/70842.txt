414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Saxophone player?
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
What makes you so sure?
Just my feminine intuition.
