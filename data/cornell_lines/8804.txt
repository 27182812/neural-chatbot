Any particular reason?
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
