Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
When was the last time?
Why?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
