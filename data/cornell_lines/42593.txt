And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
The white kind.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Yeah, but...
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
