All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
One that looks nice.
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Yes ...
Now - go!
