That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Do you really?
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Where did you hear that?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
