But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
What?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Oh Marge.
