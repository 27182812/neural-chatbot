Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I'm through, Xander.
I can see that. Why?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
