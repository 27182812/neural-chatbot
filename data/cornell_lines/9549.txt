You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
