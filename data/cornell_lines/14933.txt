Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She talk about the boys?
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
