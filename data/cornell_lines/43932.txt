What's this?
A car.
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
It's for you.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Okay.    Okay.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
