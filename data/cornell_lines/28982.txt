When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
You're kidding.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
