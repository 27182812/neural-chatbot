This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
I'm very, very serious.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
