Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Left behind?
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Soran?
All of us.
Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.
