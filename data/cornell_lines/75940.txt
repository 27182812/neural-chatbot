Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
No. What are you looking for?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
And be crushed.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
