I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
What about him?
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
How do you know?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Is that what you're thinking about?
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
