I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
How can you say that, Sailor?
What makes sense, is all.
