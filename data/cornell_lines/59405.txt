Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
I have work to do at the plant.
I'll get my purse.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
