Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
