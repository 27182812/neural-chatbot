What a pretty tune.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
