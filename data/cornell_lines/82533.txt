What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
What the hell are you talking about?
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Who’s she?
Elektra King.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.
