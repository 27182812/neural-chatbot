What can I do for you?
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
That ain't me.
It's not?
You don't know who the fuck--
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
