No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
I'm sorry.
