It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
