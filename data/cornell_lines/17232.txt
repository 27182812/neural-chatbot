You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
It's Stanley, sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
What was it called, sir.
Boogerland!
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
