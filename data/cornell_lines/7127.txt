Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
But you're my father -
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
