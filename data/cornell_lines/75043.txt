What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Hey?
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Who remembers.
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight.  What about just now?
Just now?  Overnight?
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
I don't believe it.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
