Faith OK?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Looks like she was holding out.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
