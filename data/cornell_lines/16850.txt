Are you talking?
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.
Why wouldn't she leave?
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
I would have killed him.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
