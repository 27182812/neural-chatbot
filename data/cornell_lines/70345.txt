I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
Why? Hi, Karl.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
