I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.

Make a "U" and go back.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
