As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
