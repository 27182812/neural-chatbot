You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I was, later.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
I know exactly what you mean.
How could you?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
...Something like that.
