Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Send that.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Next month is June.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
June? That's my wife's name.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
O.K.! Send that!
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
