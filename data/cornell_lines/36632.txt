I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
