So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
Well, it's kind of weird.
We don't judge here.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
And how do you feel about that?
I don't wanna take over the family business.
