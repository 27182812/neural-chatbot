We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case of what?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
