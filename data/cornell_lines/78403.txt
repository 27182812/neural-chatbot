I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Those boys never did have good luck.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
