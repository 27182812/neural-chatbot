Who are you?  Do you have a job?
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
And now you wanta teach me?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Annie, I think you should leave.
