Very pretty. Now what?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
