I have eighteen more minutes!
I don't want to hear any more today.
Why not?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Good, then go.
