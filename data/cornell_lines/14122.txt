Is that a threat?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
That's why we hire scientists...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
