Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Alright.
