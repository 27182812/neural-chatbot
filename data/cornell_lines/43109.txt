Where'd you get it?
You do recognize it then?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
You sound so sure.
