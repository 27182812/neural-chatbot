Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Look, this is different.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Like hell it does.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
That's the point.
I don't get you, King.
I said that's the point!
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Then get off my back!
