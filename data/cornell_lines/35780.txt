You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
So?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Lucky break!
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Did you see anything in the files?
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Yeah, somewhere?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
And if you're wrong.
Siberia.
What do you want me to do?
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Good, what's his number?
