The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Uh-huh.

Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
