Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
