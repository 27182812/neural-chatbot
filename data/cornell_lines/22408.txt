Shall we proceed?
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Oh?
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
