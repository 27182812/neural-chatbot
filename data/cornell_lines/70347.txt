What's you last name?
Childers.
What are all them books?
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Don't you live somewhere?
I did live there in the state hospital.
Why'd you live there?
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
They let you out?
Yeah.
How come?
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
Are you well?
I reckon I feel all right.
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
