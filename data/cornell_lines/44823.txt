Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Datura.
What?
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
