I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
Are you?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
We talked.
