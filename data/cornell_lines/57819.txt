Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Why?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
Why not?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
