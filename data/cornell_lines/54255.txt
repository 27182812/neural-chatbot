I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Why?
I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
