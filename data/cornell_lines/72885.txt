No, not really.
Any books you like to read for fun?
No.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I hate reading.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
OK.
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
I dunno...
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
