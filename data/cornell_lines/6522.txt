To coincidence.
There's a casino in this hotel.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
So why did you come to my casino?
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
First visit to London?
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Near the casino.
In the casino.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
The debts.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
