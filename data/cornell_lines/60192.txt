I've got to go --
Did I say something wrong?
No, it was so right it scares me.
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
Why?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
