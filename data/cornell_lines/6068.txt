Permission to come aboard, sir.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
