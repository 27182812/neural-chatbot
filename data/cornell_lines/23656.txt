What who's been sayin'?
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
Believe what you want.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
What?
You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
