Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
