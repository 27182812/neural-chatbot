Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
What happened to her?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
No.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
