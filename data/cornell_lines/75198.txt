Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
His eyes are open.
Uh... you're under arrest.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
You'll go to the prison hospital.
Under arrest for murder.
