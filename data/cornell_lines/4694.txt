Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
My father is a genius.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
