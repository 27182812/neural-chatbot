I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
Only me and Mom ..
How about any guys on your staff?
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
