There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
