What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Yeah.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
When was this, like '96?
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
You weren't even alive!
