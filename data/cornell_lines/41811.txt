Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
...-er.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
No, no, no.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
...-er.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Am I missing somethin' here?
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...

I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  We're goin' to McGruder.
