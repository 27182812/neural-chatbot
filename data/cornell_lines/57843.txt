Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
No, I came because we need -
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Five... so far.
All flayed...?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
I didn't.
No. You ate yours.
