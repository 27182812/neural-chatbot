Would you have called her?
Who?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
I don't know.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
