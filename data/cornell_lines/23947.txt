Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Where did you get the gun?
In my mother's drawer.
