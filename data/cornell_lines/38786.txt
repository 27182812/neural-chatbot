What time are visiting hours?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Well. Okay.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
