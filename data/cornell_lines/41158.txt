Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
What makes you say that?
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Who?
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
