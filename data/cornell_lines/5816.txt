Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Sam?
Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
-- Is what?
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
