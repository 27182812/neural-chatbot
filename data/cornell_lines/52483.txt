Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Diane!
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
