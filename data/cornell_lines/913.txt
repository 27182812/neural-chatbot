Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
It was a lot of fucking money.
