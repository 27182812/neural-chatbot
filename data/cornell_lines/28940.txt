Hello Marge.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Where's Dickie?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Ha. Did he say why?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
What does that mean?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
