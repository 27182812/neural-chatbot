And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Pray.
