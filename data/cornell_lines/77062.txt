"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Rosebreen.
Could this be him?
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
