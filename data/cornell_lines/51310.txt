Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...

It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.
