Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And now, drum roll please...
Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
