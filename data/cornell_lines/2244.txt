What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Me?
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Well, you can. You always could.
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
