Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
When will I see you again?
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
