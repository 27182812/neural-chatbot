King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Forget it.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Sure, King.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
