There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
