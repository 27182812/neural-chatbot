Tell me about your friend Creasy.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Two tourists who never went home.
You helped him get this job.
That's what friends do.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
I can take care of myself.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
