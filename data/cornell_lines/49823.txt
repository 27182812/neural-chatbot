I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Harry S. Truman?
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Right.
Well, I'm fully covered.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Come on in.
