Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Fifty thousand dollars!
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
