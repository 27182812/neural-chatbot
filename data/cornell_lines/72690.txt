Our children.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Not to me.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
