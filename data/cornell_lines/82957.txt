I beg your pardon?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
