Where have you been?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
What is that... wailing?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
