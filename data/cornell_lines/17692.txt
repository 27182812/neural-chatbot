You see, it's not a dream.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Why?
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
Struggling, why?
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
I was just going to.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Why, mother?
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
