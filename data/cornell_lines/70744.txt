Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
What do you think you're doing?
