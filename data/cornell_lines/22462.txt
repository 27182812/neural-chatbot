We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
When?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Long time.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Not held, just slowed down.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.
