The evil eye doesn't work on me.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
You're a drunk fool.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
