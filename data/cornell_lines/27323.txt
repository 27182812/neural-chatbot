Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
