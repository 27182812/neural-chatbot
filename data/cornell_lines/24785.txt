I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
But I like teaching school.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Redi's all right.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
She's a pretty good sort.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
