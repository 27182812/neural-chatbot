Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
Oh, me -
How old did you say you were?
I didn't say.
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
I work at Seligman's.
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
