You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
Can't you give it to me later?
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
