Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Yes it is...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
So there is only one key...
That's right...
And it can't be forged?
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
