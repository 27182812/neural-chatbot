That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
And that's a good thing?
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
