That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
