Why're you driving so fast?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Who'd want to?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
But you could get killed, right?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
An existentialist.
A what?
Eyes on the road.
