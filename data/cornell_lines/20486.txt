Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
Oh?
