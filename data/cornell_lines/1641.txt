Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
How the hell do you know that?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
