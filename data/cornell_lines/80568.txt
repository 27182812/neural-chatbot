Hello.
Hey. It's me.
Where are you?
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
How late?
No. Just like an hour or so.
What about the chairs?
Okay.
What okay?
What!
The chairs.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
