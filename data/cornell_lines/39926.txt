You can't believe how much he's improved.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
A medical miracle.
