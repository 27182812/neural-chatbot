Call the Homicide Squad!
How's every little thing?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
No kiddin'.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
What does that prove?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
