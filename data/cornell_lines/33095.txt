Who knew she was pregnant?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Was it you?
Is it because she's a nun?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
For what?  An abortion?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The baby?
The scandal...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
She didn't want any help.
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's a lie.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
And the baby.
No!
You tied the cord around its neck.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Before or after you killed the child?
I left it with her and I went for help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Then she's a liar.
