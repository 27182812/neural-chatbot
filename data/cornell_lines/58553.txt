Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Yeah, they told me.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
