I didn't have a chance to thank you.
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.

We need to talk.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?

So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Actually, no.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard.
Somehow I guessed.
