He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Why is he doing this?
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
