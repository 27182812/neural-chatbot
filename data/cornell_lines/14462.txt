If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
