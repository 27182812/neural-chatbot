I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Let my kid go.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
