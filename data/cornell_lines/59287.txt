Zydowski.  It's about time.
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Yeah?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
What?  Wait a minute -
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
