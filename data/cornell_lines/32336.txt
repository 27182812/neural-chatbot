I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Just a place.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
