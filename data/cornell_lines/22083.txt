By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
I'm a little late, that's all.
How late?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
