Temperature's dropping.
Yes.
I guess you can't invite me in?
No.
People home.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
I'm a little cold.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for you.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night.
