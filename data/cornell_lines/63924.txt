Jack?
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Shit.
