What, um...  What do we do?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Why do you keep saying that?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Oh, him.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
What?
We'll cover it later.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
