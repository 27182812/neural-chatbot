Pleasure.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Ah.
You must know Ian.
I don't.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
