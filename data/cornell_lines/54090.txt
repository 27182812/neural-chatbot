I want to know what in hell you're doing.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --

-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?
