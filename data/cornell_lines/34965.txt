She doesn't seem to like you very much.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
Open it.
