And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
I know.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's a ghost!
He's alive!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
Thank you, kind sir.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
A what kind of doctor?
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
That's an interesting piece of news.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Not true.
Still lives with his mother.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
How did she lose her feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I didn't know that.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
