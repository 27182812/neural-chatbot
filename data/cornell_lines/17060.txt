Damn, it was getting hot in there.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Go where, Ray?
Back to New York for starters.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
