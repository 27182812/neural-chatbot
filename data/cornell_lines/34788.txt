Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
You're not serious.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
God willing.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Why?
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Excuse me?
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
