Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
