Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Very good.
