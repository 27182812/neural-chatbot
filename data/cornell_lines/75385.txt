What're we doing here, Truman?
This is where it started.
What exactly?
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
No.
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Yeah...
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Really?
