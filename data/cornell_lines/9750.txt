I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
