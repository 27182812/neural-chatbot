Do they come with batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
