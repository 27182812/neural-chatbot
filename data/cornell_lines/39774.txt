Look at that - right on time.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Every day?
Turn around!
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
Security.
You're joking.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
I thought you arrested me.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
Cut it out, Sam.
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
Turn!
Stop it ... damn you!
