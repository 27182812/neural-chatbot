Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Yes, I am.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Excuse me?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Excuse me?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
