Dr. Green...
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
They're all heavily armed.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
What was it?
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
