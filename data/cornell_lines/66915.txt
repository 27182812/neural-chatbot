Gregor, is that you?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
So what do we do?
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
