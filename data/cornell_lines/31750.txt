Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
