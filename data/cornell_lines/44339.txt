So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It stands so still.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
May I pet the deer?
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
I want to touch it.
