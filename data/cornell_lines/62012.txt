Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
No, no no....
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
