Why would anybody want to hurt you?
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Where'd they take you to?
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
No -- nothing.
