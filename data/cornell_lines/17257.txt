So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
So I followed him...
You followed him?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You keep a bat under your seat?
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Yes, great movie...
I was DeNiro!
