Hello.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
What?
