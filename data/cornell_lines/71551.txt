He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.

Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.

Millie, I know what I'm doing.
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
