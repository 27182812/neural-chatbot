What time is it?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
I can't sleep.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
