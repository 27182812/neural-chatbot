Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
