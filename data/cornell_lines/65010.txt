A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
I see.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
What did you say his name was?
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
As I said before...
Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
