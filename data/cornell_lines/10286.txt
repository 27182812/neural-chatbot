Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
We don't have a relationship.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
I'd rather not.
