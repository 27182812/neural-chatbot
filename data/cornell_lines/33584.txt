Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
