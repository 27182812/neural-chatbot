That's right.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Yes.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
What is your point?
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
I..
...yes...?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
You want some <u>advice</u>.

Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
...why?
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
