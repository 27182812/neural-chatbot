I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
