How did you get that bracelet?
You like it?
I always did.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Thirty-four.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
