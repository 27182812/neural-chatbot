Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Six years.
And would you describe those years as happy?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
No, I did not.
Did you wish to?
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
And what is your present salary?
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
