Welcome to the club.
Excuse me?
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Uh-huh.
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
I know his work better than I know him.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
What about his girlfriend?
What about which girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Would you know where I might reach her?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Could that be Camden Market?
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Fucked-up fucking weird.
