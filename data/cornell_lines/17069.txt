Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
It's too late for plans.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
