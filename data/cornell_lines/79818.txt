How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Seventy-five percent.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
