Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
