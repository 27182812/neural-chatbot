They're more afraid of you.
Well, now I feel so much better.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Whose orders were those?
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
And how do you know that?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
