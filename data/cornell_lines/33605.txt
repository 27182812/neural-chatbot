After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
That's right.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Yes. I do.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Yes. The Shubert.
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Eddie...
Eddie what?
