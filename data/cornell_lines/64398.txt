The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Richard, take it easy.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Give me some credit, will you?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Wbat're you talking about?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
Sixty—forty.
