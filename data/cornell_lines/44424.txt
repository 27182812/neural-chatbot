Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Maybe they have to pee.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
