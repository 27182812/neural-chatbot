I'm not going!
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
