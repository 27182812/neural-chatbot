She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She says it's not.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
