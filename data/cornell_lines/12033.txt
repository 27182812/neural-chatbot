She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
That's what I said.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
You can be and are wrong.
