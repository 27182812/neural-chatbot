I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Of course.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
