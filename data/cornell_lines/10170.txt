You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
What?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
So where would we go?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I dunno, I...
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
I-I-I...
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
