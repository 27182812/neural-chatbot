You're wrong.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
No.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
No.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
No.
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
