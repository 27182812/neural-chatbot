You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
I don't like anything else.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
Talk to me.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
You got my back.
