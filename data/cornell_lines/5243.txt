Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
