But there is a family resemblance.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
We planted it.
Is this your shovel?
No.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Officer, I can explain.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Where are the papers?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Wait here.
Because if you are...
Lady! Be quiet.
