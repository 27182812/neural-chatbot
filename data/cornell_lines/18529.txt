I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
It's her baby too, you know.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Well, it ain't your baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
You told me.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
What happen?
She gave me the evil eye.
