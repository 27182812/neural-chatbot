Hello? You there?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Never heard of him.
Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
