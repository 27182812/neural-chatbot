Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Do you have to say that?
What?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Well, I wonder why.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
I have a pretty good idea.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
He doesn't have a phone.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
But he won't.
What are you talking about?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Let me talk to him first.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
And what?
And... do whatever it is you do.
