We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
