My God! What happened?
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
What happened to Katka?
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
Holly!
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
It just happened.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
She's cool.
A fine specimen for conversion.
What are you on about?
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
