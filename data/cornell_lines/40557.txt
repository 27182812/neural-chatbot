You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I want to be had.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
He won't make love to me anymore.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I want you desperately!
