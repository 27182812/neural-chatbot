My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
But you needed a drink first.
Yes.
Now you've had your drink.
