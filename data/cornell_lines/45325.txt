I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
I didn't.
You're lying.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
You know that you're in my house.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
That's my problem, Belle.
