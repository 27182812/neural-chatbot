The guy ain't here yet.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Which one?
Dental School.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I have first dibs.
Says who?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Like hell you are!
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks?
Twenty bucks.
All right, asshole, you're on.
