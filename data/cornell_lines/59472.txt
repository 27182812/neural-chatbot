And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
Stuart is fine.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
No.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
