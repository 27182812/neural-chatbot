--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
I know that.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Susan!
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
