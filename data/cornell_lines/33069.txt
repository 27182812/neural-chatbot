You hate us don't you?
What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
The Catholic Church...
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
