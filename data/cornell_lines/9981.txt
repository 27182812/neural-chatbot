Pumpkin, are you in there?
Are you going to yell at me?
About what?
Yeah, I heard about that.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
I just buzzed him in.
