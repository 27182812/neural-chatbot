There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
I already have an employer.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Who told you about her?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
It was the mall.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Those were just fantasies.
