There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Somebody told her.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Why would I lie?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
I'm concerned about her health.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
