Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
