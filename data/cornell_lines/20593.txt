Just a little.
I can't taste nothing.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
What?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Damn, you got a stalker.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
You don't know Baby D.
