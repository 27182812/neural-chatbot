You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
You should have proved that in a court of law.
My lawyer was a bum.
I agree.
