Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
So, what's your point?
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
