Who'd ever think, to look at you?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
