What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Oh, like that song...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Him?
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
