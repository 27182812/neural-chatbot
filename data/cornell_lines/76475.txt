Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Your secretary, huh!
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry.
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
