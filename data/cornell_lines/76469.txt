Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
How are you, Jane?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
No.
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
Good.
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
