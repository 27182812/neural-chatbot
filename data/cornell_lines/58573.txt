I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
No, yes, it does...
Yeah? But look at you.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
But, I'm mean.
That's ok.
And marriage, does that get easier?
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
Oh.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
That's too scary.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
No one ever tells you that...
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Where'd you grow up?
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
