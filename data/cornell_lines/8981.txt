Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
What?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Seth, if you were me --
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
