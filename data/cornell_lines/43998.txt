We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
But don't be too lenient.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
A murderer?
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
