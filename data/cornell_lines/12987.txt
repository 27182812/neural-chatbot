Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Yes, darling.
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
Fifteen.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Yes, darling.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Yes.
Flares?
Absolutely.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
That's very funny.
I love you so much.
