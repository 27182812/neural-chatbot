I said another man was buried in his place.
Where's Harry?
That's what we want to find out.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I don't know.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
