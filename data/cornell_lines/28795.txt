The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
