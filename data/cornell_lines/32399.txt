Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
So whose car is it?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
The hood jumper?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
Such as.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
...we find the jacket.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
No wonder he screwed us over.
