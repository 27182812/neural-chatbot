I'm homesick.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
