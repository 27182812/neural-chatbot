You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
