You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
