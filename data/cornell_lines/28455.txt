He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Dick Low's a killer too.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
