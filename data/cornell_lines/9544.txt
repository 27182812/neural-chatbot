Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
