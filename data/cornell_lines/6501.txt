Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Are you drunk?
Probably.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Marion, stop this.
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
