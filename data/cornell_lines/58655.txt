Yes.
And how would you describe him?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Seemed...on edge.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
Just me.
