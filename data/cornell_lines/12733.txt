Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
What?
Cone.
Huh... what cone?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
