I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Not me.
Yeah? Why're you here?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Do you go to school?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
