Tent poles.
Uh-huh.
You already have the tent?
Somethin' like that.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
What kind of tent?
The kind with the most poles.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
