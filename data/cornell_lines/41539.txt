Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
