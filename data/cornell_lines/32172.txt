Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Artie? That you, Artie?
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
