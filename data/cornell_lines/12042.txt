May I help you?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh.  That's me.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  Why?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Oh.  Okay.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
