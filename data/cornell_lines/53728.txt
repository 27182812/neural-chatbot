Upset!  What's he upset about?
Said he's not an actor.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
She's talking to him now.
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
