What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
