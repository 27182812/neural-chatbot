Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Your Honor -- please!
