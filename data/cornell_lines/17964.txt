You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
The system would collapse.
I believe in that system...
Do you?  Really?
