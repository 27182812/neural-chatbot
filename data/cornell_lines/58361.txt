Steve called for you.
Steve?
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
The Sheriff.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
You told me one time it was true love.
