...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
This is Quint, Missus.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
He's busy.
Well... is everything all right?
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
