I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
That's not going to help.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
How?
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out.
