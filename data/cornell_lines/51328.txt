What do you mean gone?
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Why didn't someone tell me!
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
