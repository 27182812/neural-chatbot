What's your name?
Alexander.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
No, we created the Morlocks.
Created?
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
As slaves.
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
