Leave her alone, you fiend!
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
If I could get my hands on you...
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
I do not joke in my proposal.
