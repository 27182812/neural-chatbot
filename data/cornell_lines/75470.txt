I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
How?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
