If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
