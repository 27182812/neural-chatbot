Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
How do you know?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
What did she have to say?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Who?
Sarah.
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
