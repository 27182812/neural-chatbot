Minimal.
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
You are an academic.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
It doesn't matter what I think.
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
