Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
