I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
