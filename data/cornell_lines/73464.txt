Well?
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I wrote that with my heart.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I will not have it butchered.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I don't know.
What month?
December twenty-first.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Thank you.
I want you to do this work.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
I don't care.
