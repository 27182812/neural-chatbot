There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I mean with the Manchester people?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All right.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
