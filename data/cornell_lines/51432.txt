You ever been married, Hanna?
Of course.  I am married still.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Then you're as single as I am.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
You're sure of that?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
