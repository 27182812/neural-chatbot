I wanted to give it all to the church.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
I want someone to talk to ...
You can talk to me ...
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
Why don't you?
I can't be honest with them.
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
