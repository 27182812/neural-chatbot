What the fuck am I doing here.
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Shouldn't take it personally.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Best game in the world.
Never.
The fastest.
