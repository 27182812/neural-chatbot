When do you have to go back?
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Then how come you're not with him?
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
