I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
