Okay, Sal ... what do we do?

I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
What kind of a deal?
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?

... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
We'd kill ourselves.
Does that still go?
We're not there yet.
