I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
You'll like it here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
