Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one — so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -— he doesn't make her laugh —— he just sits and talks.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
