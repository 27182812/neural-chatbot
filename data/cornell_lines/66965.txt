That makes twice now you've saved my life.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
Not exactly.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
And what job is that?
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
