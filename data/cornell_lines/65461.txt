I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Why not?
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Was someone rude to you?
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
