We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
