What time did this thing happen?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
If he can do it, yes.
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
