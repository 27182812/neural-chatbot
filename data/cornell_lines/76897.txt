You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
We'll get by without 'em.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
I never played for winos.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
Then you'll do it?
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
