You were not.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?

"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
