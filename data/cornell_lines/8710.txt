In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
I don't know.
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
