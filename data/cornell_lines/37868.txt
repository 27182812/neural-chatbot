How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
What kind of circumstances?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
The Great Mantini?
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
But I think I have another plan.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Why are you being like this?
