I want you to look at one another...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
...never done a thing for you?
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  Get yourself some CDs.
