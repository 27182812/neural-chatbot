Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.
