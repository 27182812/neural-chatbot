We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Really? That's amazing.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Thanks.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Psychology.
