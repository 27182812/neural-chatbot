Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Really?
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
Sounds good...
