Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
No way!
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
