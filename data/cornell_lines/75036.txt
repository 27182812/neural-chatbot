Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
-- Your employer?
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
What line is he in.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
I see.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
I bet.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Right.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
