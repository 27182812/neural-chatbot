Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
Stop tripping.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
What are you so worked up about?
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
He's just being nice.
Nice!
He's completely innocent.
Innocent!
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
You are too crude.
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
