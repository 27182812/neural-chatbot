No!  No!  I can't do this!
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
