Is that how you answer the phone?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Who did it?
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
And what's the mysterious code word?
Peaches.
What?
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
