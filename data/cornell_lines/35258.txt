What will you do after the war?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What's a big question?
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Yes.
What did you hear?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
What things?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
Yes.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
I know.
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
