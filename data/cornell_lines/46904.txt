Hey!
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Seat 74.
You're Brill.
