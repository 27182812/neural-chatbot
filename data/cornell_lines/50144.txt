You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
Yeah.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
They around?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
I'll go find Hayes.
