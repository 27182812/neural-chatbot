Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
Maybe you can, Libby.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
So do I...
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
I'm sure you're right.
