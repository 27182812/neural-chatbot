Hello, Denby!
I thought I put you to bed.
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Well, did you find me?
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
