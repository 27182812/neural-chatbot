Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
