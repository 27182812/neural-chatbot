Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Which part?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
