Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
And it worked?
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
