Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
Who says you're the good guys?
