Who are you?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Oh?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You're also a fool.
I think you should go now.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
