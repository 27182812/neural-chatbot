And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Yes.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
