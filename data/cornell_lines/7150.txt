With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Anything else?
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Fine.  We gotta him.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Sure.
Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
