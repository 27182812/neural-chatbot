You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Bledso
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
He still living?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
