Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
