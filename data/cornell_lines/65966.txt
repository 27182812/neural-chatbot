There's no hurry. It's early.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Why didn't you eat last night?
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
