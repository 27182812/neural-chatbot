Claudia, let's get married?
What! Get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
That's why I asked you...
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
