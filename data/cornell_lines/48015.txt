Hey, Father? You like movies?
Very much.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
That's to bad.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Who's in it?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
I've seen it.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Come on!
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Who?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
I could have you deported, you know that?
