I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
No, you should forget about last night.
Laura, I am your friend.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
You're not mad at me?
No.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
What can I tell you?
How did the car get back here?
WE got it back, that's all.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
I can't help you there.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
But I love you, Laura.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Why do you do it, Laura?
Cause I like it.
