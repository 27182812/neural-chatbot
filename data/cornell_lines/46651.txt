Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Yes.  But do you know?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
How'd she meet Patchett?
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Tell me about Patchett.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
