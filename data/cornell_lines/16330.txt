I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Do they have drinks?
