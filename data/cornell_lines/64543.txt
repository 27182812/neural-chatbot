A regular all-American guy?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
I still am.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
No. I didn't.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
