What's this?
Turbine rotor's shot.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Hard to say.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
What about running number two by itself?
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
How long, then?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
How long?
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
