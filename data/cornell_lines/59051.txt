How you doing?
I'm drinking.
Slowly or quickly?
As fast as I can.
Come home soon after the show.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
-- did she talk to you?
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Did you tell her?
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
I love you.
Love you too..
Bye.
