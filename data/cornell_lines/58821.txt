So how come you could play basketball?
I just can.
I never knew a girl that could play.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
Your Dad play?
He works at a bank.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I don't know.  A lot.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
You do act different.
I don't care.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
