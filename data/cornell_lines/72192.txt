The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Yes.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
