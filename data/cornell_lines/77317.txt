We should head Northeast.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
