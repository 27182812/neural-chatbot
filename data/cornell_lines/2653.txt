Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
