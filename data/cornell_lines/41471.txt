Having two pints in the Rock.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Who's Dil?
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
We don't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Yes.
