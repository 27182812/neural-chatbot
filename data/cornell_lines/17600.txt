There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Leaving?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
When are you going to start?
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
You mean you don't want to go?
Well - I'm—
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
