You're too kind.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
That's beautiful.
