Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Of course.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
What do you want to know, Evan?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
I know, but...
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
