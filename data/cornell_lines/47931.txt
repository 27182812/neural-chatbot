Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
A stimulant.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Depression?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
And those lies she's been telling?
Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Never.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
