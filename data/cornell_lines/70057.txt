Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
I am?
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Really?  Lieutenant?
I've been worried about you.
