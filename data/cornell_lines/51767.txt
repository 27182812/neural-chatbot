Slip it in ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
The alarms go off ...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
I do ... I cut "em...
Cut 'em...
Now... I'm in ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
No worries ...
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
