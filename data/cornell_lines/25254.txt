Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
She is very hot.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
