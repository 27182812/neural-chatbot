Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
