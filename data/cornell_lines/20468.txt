Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
And where is the army?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
And who is defending Paris?
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
