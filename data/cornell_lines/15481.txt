Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
