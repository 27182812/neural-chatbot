Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
I'll manage.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
No, I'm ok.
