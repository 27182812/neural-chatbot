Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
