Woman, what are you doing here?
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
