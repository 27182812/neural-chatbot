Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
I keep the heat on.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Kept us warm for twelve years.
