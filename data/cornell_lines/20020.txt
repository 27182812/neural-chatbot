Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I've had my moments.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
What do you do?
Althea hasn't told you?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
You've done well.
