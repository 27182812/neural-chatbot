I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
