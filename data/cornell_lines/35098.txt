Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
All set for what?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Atlantic City?
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Baxter?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
He wouldn't.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
The nerve.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
What are you talking about?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
