He was unsual.
Why?
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
No.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
I don't follow you.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
The boy _died_?
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
