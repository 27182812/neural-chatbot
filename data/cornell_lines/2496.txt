I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
You didn't want to farm?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
A river pirate.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
And what's this right girl like?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Where will you find such a girl?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
