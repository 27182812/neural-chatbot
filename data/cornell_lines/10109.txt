May I ask what you're doing?
Shhh!
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
