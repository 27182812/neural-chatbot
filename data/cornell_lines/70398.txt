I don't think I've ever seen you before.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What brings you back?
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Do you have family here?
Not really to speak of.
