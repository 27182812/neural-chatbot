But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Why?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Out of kindness.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
So what are you going to do about her?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
And you're mine.
You're the only person I can trust.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
They weren't at school with us.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Take her off the list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Say it was a mistake.
We don't make mistakes.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
