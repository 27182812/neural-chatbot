Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
What other job you got?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I don't wanna work at all.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
'At's-a fine.
