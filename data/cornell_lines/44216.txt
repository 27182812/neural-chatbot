What's wrong with you?
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Interesting.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
No.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
