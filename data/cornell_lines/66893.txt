It's quite satifactory.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
You sure about this?
I'd stake my reputation.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
