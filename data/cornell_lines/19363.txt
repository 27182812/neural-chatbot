Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Who'll make the rules?
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
