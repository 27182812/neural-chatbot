The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm telling you it's not.
