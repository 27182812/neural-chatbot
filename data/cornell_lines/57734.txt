He just came up screaming.
Did he say anything?
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Yes.
Is the dead guy in there?
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
