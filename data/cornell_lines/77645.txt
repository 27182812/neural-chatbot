Yes, m'sieu.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Very well, m'sieu.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.
I know it!
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just call me Gaston.
