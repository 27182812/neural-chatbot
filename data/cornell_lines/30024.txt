Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
How did you know?!
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
1899.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
What are you?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --

And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
