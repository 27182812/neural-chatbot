John?  John where are you going?
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
John, please--
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
What are you talking about?
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
