So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
You know who Muhammad was?
Some prophet guy?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Frightening thought.
We're all on the same hajj now.
