You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
For two hundred?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
You mentioned information.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
A thousand.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
Get it in half an hour.
