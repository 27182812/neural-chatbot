What's- It's me, open up.
Oh.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
There's a spider in the bathroom.
What?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Oooh.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
No.
