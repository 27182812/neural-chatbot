Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
She said that?
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
Now listen...
No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission.
