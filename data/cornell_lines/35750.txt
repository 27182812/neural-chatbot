I'd love to get in there.
Don't we have enough already?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
