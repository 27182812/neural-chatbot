Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
