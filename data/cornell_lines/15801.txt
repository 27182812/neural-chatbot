You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
I wouldn't know.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
What do you want?
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
