God, Flash can be such a jerk.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."

Does it have a human name?
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
I'd never admit that.
Hurry up, Flash!
