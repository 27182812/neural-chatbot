I'm hungry.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
What did all this stuff cost you?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eggs. How do you like them?
Raw.
