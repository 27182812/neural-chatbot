Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
What makes you so sure?
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
