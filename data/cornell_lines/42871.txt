Annie...it's Max.
Max...
Max, the cab driver!
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Dmitri hired him!  He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  He was stalking you when I dropped you off.  I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
