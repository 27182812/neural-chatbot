Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?

I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
I told you, something's upset them.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
I'm sorry.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
