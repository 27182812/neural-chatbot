Careful.  That's bad luck.
That place is already bad luck.
Why?
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
What else does she say?
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Lucky thing.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
The dead get out?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
And you believe her?
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
