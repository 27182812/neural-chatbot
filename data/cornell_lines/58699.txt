Do you know your parents' blood types?
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Then why are you here?
