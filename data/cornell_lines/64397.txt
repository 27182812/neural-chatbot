You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
