You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
What's that?
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
