Think me fair, do you, Jack?
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
