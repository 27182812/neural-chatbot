Good morning.
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
Oh yeah.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Yes...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Well ain't you amazing.
