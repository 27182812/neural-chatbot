Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
