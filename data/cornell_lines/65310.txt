You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
