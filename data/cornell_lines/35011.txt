To me?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Sir?
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
I know how it is.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
