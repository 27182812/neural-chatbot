This your present address?
Yes.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Did you know the victim?
No.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
It doesn't.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
