It was crazy not to have destroyed them
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
And what of these foreigners?
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
