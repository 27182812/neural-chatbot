I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Hold on!
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
