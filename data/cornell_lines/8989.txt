Far out.  Where are my glasses?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
