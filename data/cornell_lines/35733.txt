Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
It's big, right Jahn?
