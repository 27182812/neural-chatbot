How's the new place?
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
And the rent is okay?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Right.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
-- hospital.
-- institution.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
