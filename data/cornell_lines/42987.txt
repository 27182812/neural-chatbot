Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Dmitri?
The man who hired me for this contract.
I don't get it.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
That's jazz, my friend.  You said it yourself.  So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
