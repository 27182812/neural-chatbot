They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Does she know anything about babies?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
