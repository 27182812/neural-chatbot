...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
You guys been holding hands?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
What homicide?  Phil.  Where's a body? Look.  All we got is glass...
