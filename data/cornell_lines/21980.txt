Where's your ring, honey?
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
It's just a symbol, honey -
No weddin'.
