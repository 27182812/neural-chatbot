Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Nothing.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
It's an option.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Just forget it...
