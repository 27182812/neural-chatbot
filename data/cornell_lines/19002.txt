Tell me what's wrong.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
How can I help you with the particles?
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
