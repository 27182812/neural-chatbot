Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
What if we don't pay?
You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
What can we do?
