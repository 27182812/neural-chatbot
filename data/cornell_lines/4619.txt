Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
What?!
