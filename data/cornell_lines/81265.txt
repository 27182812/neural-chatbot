Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Yes, but...
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You think you influenced her?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
