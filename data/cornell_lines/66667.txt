She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
I'm thirty myself.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Let's get outta this stink.
