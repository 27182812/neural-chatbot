Cause she's dying.
Do you think she is?
No.
Why do you think she says that?
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
