You can't afford one?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Promise?
Yes I do.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Uh-huh.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
You should be used to that.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Llewelyn?
Yes ma'am?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
