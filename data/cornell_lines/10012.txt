Do you want something to drink?
Why?
What do you mean "why"?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Yeah, right...
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Nothing.
Then why do you hate me so much?
When did I say I hated you?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
That's just the way I am!
Yeah, well --
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
