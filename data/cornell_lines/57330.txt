I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
Two years ago? Sorry.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
