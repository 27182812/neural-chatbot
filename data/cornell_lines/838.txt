Not going to open?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
