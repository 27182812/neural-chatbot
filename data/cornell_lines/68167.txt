Morning honey.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
