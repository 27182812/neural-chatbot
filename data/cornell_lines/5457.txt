Why are you here, then?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Abbott?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
So when was I here?
What do you mean?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
No. You never worked Berlin.
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
You never worked Berlin...
