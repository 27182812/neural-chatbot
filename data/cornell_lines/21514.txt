Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Syracuse.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Ernie Davis.
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
