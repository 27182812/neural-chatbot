It's loaded with what?
Tomatoes.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
You gonna get married.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Marty...
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
Put on your blue suit...
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
You not ugly.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Marty...
Ma! Leave me alone!
