I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
How are you doing sweetheart?
I'm good.
Dating anyone?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
What pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mother!
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Behind the books.
But I was dusting.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, you never tell me anything.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
