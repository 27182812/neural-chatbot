Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Why did he do that, reckon.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Yeah, I did.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
