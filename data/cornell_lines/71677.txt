You think he killed Edmunds?
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
