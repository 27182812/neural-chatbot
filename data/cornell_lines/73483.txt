Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.

Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
