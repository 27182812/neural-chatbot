Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
