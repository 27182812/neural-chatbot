Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
Like what?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
You were the one who got me in.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
