There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
