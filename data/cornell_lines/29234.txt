Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sandra Sinclair.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
