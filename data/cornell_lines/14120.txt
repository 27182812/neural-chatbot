Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Seven...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
