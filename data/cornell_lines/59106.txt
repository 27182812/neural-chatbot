I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
I have money.
...what...?
I have money to give you.
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
