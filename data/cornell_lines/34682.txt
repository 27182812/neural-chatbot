What is that thing?
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
You should have brought him.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
