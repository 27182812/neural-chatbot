Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
We were such desperate sluts back then.
