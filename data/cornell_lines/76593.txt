Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
