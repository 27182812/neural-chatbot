Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Like it?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No--not much--excepting--
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Do what--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
I'll never love anybody else.
