Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Could do, yeah.
