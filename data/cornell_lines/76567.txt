They've abandoned me... like everyone.
What... what do you mean?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
