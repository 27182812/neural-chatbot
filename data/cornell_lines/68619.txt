No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
You know that's not true.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
No...
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
It's been a year since she died.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
You have to move on, Sid.
