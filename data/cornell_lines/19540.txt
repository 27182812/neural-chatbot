I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
Uh-huh?
... What are they all doing there?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
