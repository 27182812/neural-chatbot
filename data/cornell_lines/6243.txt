You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
