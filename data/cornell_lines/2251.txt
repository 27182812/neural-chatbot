What's this?
My apartment.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
Good for you. Come on.
