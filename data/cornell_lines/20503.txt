Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Are you trying to insult me?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Well, you shall see.
When is she supposed to return?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
