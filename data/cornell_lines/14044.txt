I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
