Potential? I don't understand.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
I'm a bargain.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Time will tell.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
