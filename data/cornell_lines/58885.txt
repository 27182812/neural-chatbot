What will this prove?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
So?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
And what happens when you lose?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
