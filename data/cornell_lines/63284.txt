Spike.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Maybe.
And she's in your house.
Yes.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Spike!
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
