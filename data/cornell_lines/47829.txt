It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
Thank you.
