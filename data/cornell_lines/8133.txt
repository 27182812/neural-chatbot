Is everything okay at work?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
