California...
Live there?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Wait a second--
Ah, I can smell it on you.
