Oh, 'scuse me.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I never met them.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
That's what I'm here for.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
