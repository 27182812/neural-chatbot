Where the hell have you been?
We got problems topside.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
We run. You crack the pattern?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
What are you talkin' about?
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
