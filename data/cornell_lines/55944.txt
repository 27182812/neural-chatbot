Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
What about me?
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
