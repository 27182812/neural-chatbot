What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
Looks like a hold-up!
What are you going to do?
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
