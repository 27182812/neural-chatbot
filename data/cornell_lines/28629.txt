Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Mike?
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Don't call me ever again.
Wow, I guess you were home...
