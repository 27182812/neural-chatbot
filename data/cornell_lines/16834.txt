I don't beg.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I can promise you complete privacy.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
