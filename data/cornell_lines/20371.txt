At the Frankenstein Center.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
I'm going inside.
What are you talking about?
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
And what if you get killed?
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
