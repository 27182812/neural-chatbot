I'm glad things have worked out for you.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
To old friends.
