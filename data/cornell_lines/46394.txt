Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Isn't that the same thing?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
