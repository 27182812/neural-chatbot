Oh, Miss Price?
Yes, Doctor?
What exactly did he call out?
He said 'Jack'.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
What happened to them?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
