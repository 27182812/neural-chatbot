Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What is it?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Where?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died....  Jessica!
