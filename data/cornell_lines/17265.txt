That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
You think I'm a tourist?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
The South.
Really?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Why are you laughing?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
My dad's an optometrist.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
