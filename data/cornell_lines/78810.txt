How's it going with Gail?
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Six weeks!
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
Where did she come up with that?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
