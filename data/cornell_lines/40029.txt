Why not try it for a few weeks?
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
