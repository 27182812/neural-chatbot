Lisa Sherman?
Yeah. Who is she?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
What?
That's what he said.
Did he say anything else about her?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Not that I know of.
