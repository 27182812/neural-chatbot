You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
I don't know...
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
