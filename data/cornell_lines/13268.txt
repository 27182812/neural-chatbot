What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Oh?
What's his family background?
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
