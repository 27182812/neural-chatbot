You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
