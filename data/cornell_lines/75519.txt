I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
You can't quit, Scully.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
I have. I did. It's done.
Just like that --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I need you on this, Scully --
You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
