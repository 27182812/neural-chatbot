Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Ten-four, hon.
