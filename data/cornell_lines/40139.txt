Hi.  It's me.
Where are you?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Well, when?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I know.  I taped it.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
