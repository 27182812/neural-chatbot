What is your name? My name is Travis.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
No, I'm serious, really...
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
That's fine.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
