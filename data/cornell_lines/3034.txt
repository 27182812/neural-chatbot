Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
No thanks.
I meant me.
