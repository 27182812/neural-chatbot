Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
