I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
