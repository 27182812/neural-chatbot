Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
She has it now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
Not simple, no.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
