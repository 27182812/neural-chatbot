What's ailing that dog?
I dunno.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
