Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?

Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You're enjoying this too much.
