Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
That's a canopy, John.
Ohhh...
How is your tea, John?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Not at all, John.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Oh yes.
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
Of course.
