Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
I want to talk about it now.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Go home, Walter.
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
