Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
You're going to jump on me.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
What???
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Aaaaaaaaaa!
