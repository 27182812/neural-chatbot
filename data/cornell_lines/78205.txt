In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
I'm sorry.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
I appreciate your time -
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Where can I find him?
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
