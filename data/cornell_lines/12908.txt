Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
What.
