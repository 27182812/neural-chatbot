Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Hey, I like this.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
You don't have to do that.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
