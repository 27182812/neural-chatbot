Who are you?
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
I was?  How you spell that?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
I never hurt nobody...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
I never carried a gun!
