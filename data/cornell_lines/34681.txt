You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Don't you miss it?
Never.
Really.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Really?
So where is young Jonah?
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
