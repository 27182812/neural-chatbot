I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
I'm not fifteen.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.
Said what?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
