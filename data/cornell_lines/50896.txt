Why are you laughing?
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
That doesn't hurt.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
Want to cry now?
