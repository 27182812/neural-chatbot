I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized.
