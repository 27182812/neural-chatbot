...delusions and paranoia.
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
But it's...
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Give me another one, please.
