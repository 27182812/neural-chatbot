Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
