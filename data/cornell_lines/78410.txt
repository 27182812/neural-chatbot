You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
