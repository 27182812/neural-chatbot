Of course, Commendatore...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
...yes.
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory.
I'll have them picked up.
