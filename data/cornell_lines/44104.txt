Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
It's not really important.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
