When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Have them sealed off.
And how should we do that, Sir?
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
