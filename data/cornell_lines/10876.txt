You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
Well?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Yes.
And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Need any help?
No.
Have you got that skeleton key?
