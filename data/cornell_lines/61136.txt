Are you proposing marriage to me?
Yes?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
What do you mean?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I don't understand.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
This is a good suit.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Alright.
