As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Is that possible?
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Is that far from here?
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
You really must do me this one favor.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
