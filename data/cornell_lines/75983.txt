He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
