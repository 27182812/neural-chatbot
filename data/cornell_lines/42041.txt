Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
How did you find out?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Avocado groves?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
