She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
The wound is mortal.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Can you save her?
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
I don't... understand.
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
