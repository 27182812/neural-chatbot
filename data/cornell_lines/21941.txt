Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
