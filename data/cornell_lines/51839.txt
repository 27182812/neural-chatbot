We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Paulie was just talking about him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
What?
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
It's been six months.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
