Aren't you even curious?
Engine 115, right?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
