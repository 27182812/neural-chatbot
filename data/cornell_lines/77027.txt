You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.
There.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Where did you hit her?
Why... in the heart.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She fell down.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
I don't know.
Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
