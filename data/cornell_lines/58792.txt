Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
