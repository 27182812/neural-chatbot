"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
What happened to it?
Gone.  Destroyed.
I guess that's for the best.
