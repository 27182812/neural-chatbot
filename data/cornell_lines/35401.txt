Why the smirk?
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.

Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Stay out of it.
