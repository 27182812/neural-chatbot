What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--mine's better--
--no way--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
