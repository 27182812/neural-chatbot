Stop blaming yourself.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.

For what?
The truth.
Try me.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
I can do that.
