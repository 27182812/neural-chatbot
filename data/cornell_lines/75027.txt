Here, are you always this sarky?
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Weren't you on a television series?

Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Oh, it just ended, then.

When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
