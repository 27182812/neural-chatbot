You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I want the rest of the pictures.
What pictures?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I heard it was an accident.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
