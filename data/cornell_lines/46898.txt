Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
I <u>did</u> care how.
This conversation's over.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I'm sorry about that.
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
You're a moron, you know that?
Yeah.
