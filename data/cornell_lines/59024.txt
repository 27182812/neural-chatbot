Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
...are you Phil...?
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
Is Linda here?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
