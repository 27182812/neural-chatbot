C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Then wh-where do we land?
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
