Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Tell them we're working for the University.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Yep, except a name for this place.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
