Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
I didn't know you could read.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
It's e-vit-able.
Keep dreaming.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
