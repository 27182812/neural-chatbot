You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Yes.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
