I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
Is that a fact.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Four.
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
Only six?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
