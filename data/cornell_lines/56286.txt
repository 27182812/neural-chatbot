Shit....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Shove it....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Stop that!
You don't like my voice...?
I don't like the song.
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
