You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Had he been trying to blackmail you?
