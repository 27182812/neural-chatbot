Hey! Oh!
Oh, sorry -
What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
There's a lot of people here.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
Again!
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
That's enough.
I'm sorry.
