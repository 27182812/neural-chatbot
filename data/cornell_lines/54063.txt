What happened?
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
I can't go without Thomas.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
How can we get out?
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
Yes.
