Yeah.
Did you do it?
No.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
No.
Well who did?
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
How?
On my knife.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I didn't do that.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
I know.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Why?
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I didn't do it.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Please don't do this to me.
The police are on their way.
Sorry.
