Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You really love me, don't you?
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Charlie, let's make love.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Who?
