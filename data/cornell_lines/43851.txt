They were all French guys.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Yeah, French guys from France.
What'd they take?
Everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Just find them!
Okay boss.
