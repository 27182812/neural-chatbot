I want to rent this one.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I have one, but they lost it.
Who?
The people in New Hampshire.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
Well, it had sentimental value.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You haven't heard of it.
What's it called?
"Anguish."
