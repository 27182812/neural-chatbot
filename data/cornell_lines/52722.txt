Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
I don't want to.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
