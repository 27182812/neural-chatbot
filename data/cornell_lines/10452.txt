Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
