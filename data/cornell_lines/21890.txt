...and how long did she work here?
Oh, five years, give or take.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
I see.  May I?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
...who doesn't?
