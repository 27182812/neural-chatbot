Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
No -- I like it.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Of course not.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Much better.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
This is a bad day for me.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Why?
He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?
