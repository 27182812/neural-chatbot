But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Inside stuff?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
That's what the witnesses told him.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Still -- those witnesses.
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
