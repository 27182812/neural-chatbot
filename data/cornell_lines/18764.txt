You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
It isn't always this rough?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Our minds?
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You're an attractive man.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
Something else we have in common.
Very happily married.
Same here.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Ayuh.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Of course not.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
