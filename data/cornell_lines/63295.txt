Excuse me.
Yes.
Bad news.
What?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.

What book?

Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
