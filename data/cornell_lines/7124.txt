My dear President...  read it back...
"My dear President"...
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My dear"...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My President"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear"...
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
"My dear President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Is that all?
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
