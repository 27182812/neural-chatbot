You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Very well, proceed, sir.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
I will do so as soon as possible.
