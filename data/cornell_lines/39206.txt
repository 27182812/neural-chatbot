Boy. It sure has been a long time.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, that's a long time.
It's not that long.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
SO!
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Oh Jesus.
I simply can not stand that tone!
