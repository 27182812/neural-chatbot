You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
No ...
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
What if there is no tomorrow?
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
