Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
That bastard Pucinski...
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
This 'bout the fifth time?
