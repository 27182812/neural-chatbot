Baby, please don't... I love you.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Baby, don't do this --
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- please, baby --
-- no, it'll help me, really --
How?
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
