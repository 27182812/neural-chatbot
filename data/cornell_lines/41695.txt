I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I want you to head right home after school.
I will. Is that all?
