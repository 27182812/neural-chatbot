You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Yeah.
You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
