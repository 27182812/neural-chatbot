Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
No-one.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Is that normal?
Yes.
How did she hide it during the day?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Could there have been anyone else?
Obviously there was.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Why haven't you asked her?
