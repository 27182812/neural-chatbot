You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Would it make a difference?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
You're fucking desperate.
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
One guess.
