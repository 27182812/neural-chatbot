I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
