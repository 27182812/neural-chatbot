So watcha doin'?
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
No.  What you do today?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
