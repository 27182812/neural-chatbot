Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
