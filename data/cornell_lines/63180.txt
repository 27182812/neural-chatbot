Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Who was Gilda?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Oh.
