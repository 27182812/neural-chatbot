We all wear masks.
My life's an open book. You read?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
You are direct, aren't you?
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
