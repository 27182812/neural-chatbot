So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
No I don't.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
