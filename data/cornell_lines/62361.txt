Have your children been deaf since birth?
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
When did you start singing?
When I was little, in church.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Yes, it is --
Well, can you tell me why?
It just is.
How long have you been with them?
About three years.
And before?
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Do you ever do any writing?
No, I don't.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Do you like him?
He's a member of our congregation.
