What news?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
And the Governor?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
