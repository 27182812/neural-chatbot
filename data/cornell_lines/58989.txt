It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Picky, picky.

It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
