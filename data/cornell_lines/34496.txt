Don't give it to me. Don't!
Oooh! Here! Here!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Get him!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
