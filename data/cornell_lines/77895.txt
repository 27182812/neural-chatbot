How well do you know her?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Who with?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
What do you know about them?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can live that down, can't you?
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
