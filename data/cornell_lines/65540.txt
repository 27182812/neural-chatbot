What is it, Miss Vivian?
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
