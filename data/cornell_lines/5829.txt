Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
