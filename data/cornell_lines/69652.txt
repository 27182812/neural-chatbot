Five times a day?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Well, you know what I mean.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
Jackie --
What?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
He does?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
It's been so long I don't how long?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
I would say so, yes.
Honey?
What?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
