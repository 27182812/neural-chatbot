Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
