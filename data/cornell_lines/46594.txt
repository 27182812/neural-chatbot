So Tracy?
Yes?
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
