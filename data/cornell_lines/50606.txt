I am really, deeply sorry.
It violates so many trusts.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
