I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
