So thrive my soul--
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
