Hello?
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
You're the Oracle?
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
Yeah.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
What vase?
