Should I wake her?
No, let her rest.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Won't you be late for work?
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
