Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
On the back street — a green house
The Farren house
Do you know the people?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Are they nice?
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
