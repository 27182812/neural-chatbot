The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You afraid of the dark?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
You don't fear death?
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
More or less.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Same back at you.
