I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Really?
