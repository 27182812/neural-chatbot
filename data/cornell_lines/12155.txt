These are worth at least, I don't know --
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.

And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
