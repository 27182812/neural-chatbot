J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
What did you do that for?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
No...
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
What the hell is this all about?
