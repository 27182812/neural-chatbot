First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Just admit you're wrong.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
That is so unfair.
