Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .

Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.

Cain -- like the Bible guy?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Craig is one syllable
But it's not a great syllable
