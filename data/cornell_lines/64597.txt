Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Duh...
Since when?
Probably since she was born.
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Okay, Joe...
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Fine, Joe.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
That's perfectly clear.
Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?"
