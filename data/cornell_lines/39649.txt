You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
