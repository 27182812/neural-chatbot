Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
I thought I'd take some now.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Oh?  What's the problem?
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Tell you what?
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
What problem?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
I guess.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Why not?
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
