The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Everyday things...yes.
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.

Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
Surest thing you know.
