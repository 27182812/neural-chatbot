Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah, it was once.
