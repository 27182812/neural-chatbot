That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
