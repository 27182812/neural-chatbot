Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
Do you want to go out with me ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Yes.
Really ? On a date ?
Yes.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
As appealing as that sounds...
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Sure.
