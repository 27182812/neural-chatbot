Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
No.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Yeah.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
A little what?
You know what I'm saying.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
How long you and me known each other?
A long time.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
A fog bank.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
