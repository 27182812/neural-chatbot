Are you O.K.?
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Why?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
