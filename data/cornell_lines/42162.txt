Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Oh no.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
The obituary column?
You'll find one of those people.
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
