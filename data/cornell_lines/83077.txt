An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.

My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
