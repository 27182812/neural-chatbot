You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
