We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
You've not aged a day since then?
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
