This answers one of our questions.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Our present.
