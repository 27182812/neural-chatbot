I can't go right now.
You can't go because of Sam?
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
You can't go with me because of Sam?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
