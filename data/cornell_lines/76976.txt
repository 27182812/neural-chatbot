You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
I'll make parole.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
