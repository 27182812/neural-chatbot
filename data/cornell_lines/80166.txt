You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
It's a crime.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I . . ..
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
I...yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
I...
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
