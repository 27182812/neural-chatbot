Can I trust you, Sami?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
You haven't answered my question.
Does it really matter what I say?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I will.
You better.
