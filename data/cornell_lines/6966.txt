I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
