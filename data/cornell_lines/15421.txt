Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
