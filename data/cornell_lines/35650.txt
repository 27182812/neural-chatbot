I killed him.
Why?
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Where you wanted to be?
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
How did you get into the business?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
The C.I.A.?
More or less.
How old were you?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Jesus -- why?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
You were like a boy genius?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Why not?
I was just different.
You went from high school to the Agency?
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
No, they didn't.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Ahhhh...
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
The exotic women.
Women?  No... not really.
Why not?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why?
Because you are a women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
They tried to kill you?
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Then you went freelance?
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Tell me about the first time.
My first take?
Yes.
Why?
Because I want to know.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
Are they usually like that?
No.  Just the first one.
After that?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
That's fiction.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
