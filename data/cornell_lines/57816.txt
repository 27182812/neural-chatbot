I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
