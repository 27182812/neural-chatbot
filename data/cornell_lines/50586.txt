Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
