What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
I don't know.
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
What night?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean?
You were acting like a different person.
