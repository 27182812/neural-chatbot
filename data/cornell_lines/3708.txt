Charming Schuvaloff.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
And he doesn't care about me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He loves me, as I love you.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Tender Hegenheim.
