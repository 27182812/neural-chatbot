In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
I've got one.
Shoot, Lothar.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
That's what I said.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
What's your point, Lothar?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
