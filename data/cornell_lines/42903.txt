Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
What thing?
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
So?  It was a random thing.
I never bought that.
Oh?
Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
