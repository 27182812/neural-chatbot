Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
