I came for love...
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.

I don't know.
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
