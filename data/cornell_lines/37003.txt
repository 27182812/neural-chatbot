McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Like hell you do.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
