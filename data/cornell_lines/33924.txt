Do you feel much about the things you did?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Tell that to Muskie.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I didn't.
But you know who did.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
