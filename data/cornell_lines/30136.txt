Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Imagine that.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
