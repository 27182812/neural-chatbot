I... What do you want?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Well, what is this?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
