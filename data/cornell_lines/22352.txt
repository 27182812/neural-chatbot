I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
