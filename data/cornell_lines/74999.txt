You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
She didn't write to me, did she.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
