Who's going to want me now?
What?... Oh baby...
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
That's not true.
Why should they?
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
