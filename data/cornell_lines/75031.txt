When did you get in?
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
I might've been away for the weekend.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
