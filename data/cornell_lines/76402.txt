I’m really sorry you were not called...
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
I... Well, we’re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it’s late and with the funeral...

I... If you don’t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There’s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
