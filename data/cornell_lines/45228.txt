Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
