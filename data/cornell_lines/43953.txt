It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You're not married, are you?
What do you think?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You're probably right.
