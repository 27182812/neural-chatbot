Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
He's not going tonight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Damn straight.
