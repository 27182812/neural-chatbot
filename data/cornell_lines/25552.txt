Where is Rae?
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
What happened?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Who?
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
