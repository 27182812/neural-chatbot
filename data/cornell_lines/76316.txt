Doc -- something you said the other day --
Yes?
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
