I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
