Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I was?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
I don't get it.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
And...?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Then you think it might have worked out?
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
