Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
No, I didn't know that.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Who was the friend?
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
I'll need a last known address.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
