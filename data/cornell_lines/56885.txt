You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
They smell.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The what?
The Cretaceous.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
