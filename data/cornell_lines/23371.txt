That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
You're goin' on a trip?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
You should go on a trip.
No thanks.
So what should I do with the pudding?
Let's just leave it there for now.
