Who do we interface with on their side?
What do you mean?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
