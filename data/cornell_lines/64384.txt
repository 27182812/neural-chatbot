What's up?
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
But accidents can happen.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
