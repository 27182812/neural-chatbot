You want some coffee?
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
He's out.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Yeah? When was the last time?
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
You can't keep being his father...
