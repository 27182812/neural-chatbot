That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Not me.  Us.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Give him the money.
What?
You heard me.  Count it out.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
