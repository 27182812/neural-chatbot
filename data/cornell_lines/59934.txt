...See you tomorrow night.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Drew, you're out of line.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
