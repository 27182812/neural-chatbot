Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
Alan's in Utah.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
You are a rich woman.
See what I mean?
