That's me.
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.

I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
