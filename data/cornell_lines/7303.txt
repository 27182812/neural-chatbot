Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes sir.  What's that?
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
Yes. John wants it.
A dressing bag?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Well...
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
