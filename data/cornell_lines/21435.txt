Are you tapping Kissinger?
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
