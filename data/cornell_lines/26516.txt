He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
I don't think he wants me to find him.
