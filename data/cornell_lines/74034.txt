You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
I've been on the job.
A hot story, huh?
It was hot, yes.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Lois isn't here?
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
What's she doing in California?
It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
