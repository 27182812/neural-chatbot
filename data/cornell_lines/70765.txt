I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
I may spill something.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
We better have a drink first.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
