Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You know what I'm saying here.
