Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
What assistant?
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Gordon Cole?
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.
