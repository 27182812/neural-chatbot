He's a child!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No you don't.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Honor, I suppose.
What a handsome word.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
