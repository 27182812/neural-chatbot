--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
