Who are you?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Something about my father?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Can't it wait, then?
