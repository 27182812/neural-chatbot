Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
And you listen to that?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
What you do?
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
