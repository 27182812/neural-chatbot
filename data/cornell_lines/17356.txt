I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
For us.
