Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
To the eye? Like other men.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ——  Don't you?
