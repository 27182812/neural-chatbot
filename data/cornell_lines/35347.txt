Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
