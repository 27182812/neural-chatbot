Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
