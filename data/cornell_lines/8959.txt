What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
