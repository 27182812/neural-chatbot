I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
You could get your wish at any moment.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
The case could be made.
