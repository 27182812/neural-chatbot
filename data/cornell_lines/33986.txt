I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
To where?
Go on.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, "What's the trick?" And he replied. "The trick is not minding."
