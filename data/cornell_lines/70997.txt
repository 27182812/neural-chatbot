Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn’t one of them.
