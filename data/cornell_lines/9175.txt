Mr. Caiman, you're married.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
So have dinner with me tonight.
I can't.
It's your choice.
