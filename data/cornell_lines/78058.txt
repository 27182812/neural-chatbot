We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?

I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
