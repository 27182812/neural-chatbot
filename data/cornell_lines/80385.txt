Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Please answer my question.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
What is her name?
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Carlotta Valdes?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
