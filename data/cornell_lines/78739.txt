Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
