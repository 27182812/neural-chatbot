Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
Well there's a couple --
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
Well as a matter of --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
Yeah.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Some mistake perhaps that --
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
You must be discouraged.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
That who?
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
Someone's been doing all these things.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
What?
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
You were hired to look for Tom.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
