The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
No -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Yes -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Excellent.
