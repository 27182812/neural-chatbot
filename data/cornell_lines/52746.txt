You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
You won't come on too strong.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
I don't know.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Jamie?
