Permission to get dressed, sir?
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
