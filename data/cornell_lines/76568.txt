Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
