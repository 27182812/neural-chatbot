Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Did I urinate on your rug?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
