Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
I'm not coming back.
