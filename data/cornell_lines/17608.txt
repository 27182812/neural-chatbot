To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
That's intelligent.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Oh, good heavens, no!
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
You have no disputes over women?
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
