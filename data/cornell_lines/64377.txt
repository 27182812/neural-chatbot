What are you doing?
I'm just happy to see you.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
