"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
