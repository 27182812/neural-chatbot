Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Harry.
Harry.
I'm no bodyguard.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
When do you want me to start?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
Do you?
