You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
What?
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
