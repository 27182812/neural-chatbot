Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
How?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Right.
