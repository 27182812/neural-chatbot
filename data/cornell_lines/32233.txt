I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
What?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
