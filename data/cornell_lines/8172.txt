All right... where did you see her?
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her number?
No.
Did you get her name?
No. It's too soon.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I would. Yeah.
Really?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
