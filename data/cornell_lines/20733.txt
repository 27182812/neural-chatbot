Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
My security people are right next door.
I appreciate that.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
That's...a comfort to hear.
I have a problem.
Ah.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
