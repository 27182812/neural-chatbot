Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
I can't do it.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
Yes.
Can you walk?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Why can't it be her?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
