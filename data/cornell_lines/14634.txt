I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?

But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.

It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
