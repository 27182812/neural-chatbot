The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
