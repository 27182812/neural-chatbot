Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
