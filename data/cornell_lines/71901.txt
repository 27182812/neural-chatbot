The Empire must have gotten here first.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
