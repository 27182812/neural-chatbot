Hello, Exposition.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
What's the other?
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Carnies.
What?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
