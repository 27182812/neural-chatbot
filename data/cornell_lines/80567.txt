Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Not yet.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
That's sweet.
Well I do.
Well you should.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.
Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
I'll see you tomorrow...
