Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
