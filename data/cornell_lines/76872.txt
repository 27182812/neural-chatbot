Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
I'm out, Johnny.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.
