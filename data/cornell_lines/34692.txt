I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
You really need to be fucked.
