Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
And?
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
