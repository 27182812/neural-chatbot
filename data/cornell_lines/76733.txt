Dorota!
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
How are you doing?
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I'll see you...soon.
