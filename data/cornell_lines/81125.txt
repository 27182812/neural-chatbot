So what's the problem?
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
