Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
About what?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
Mr. Gardner, I --
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
Of course.
