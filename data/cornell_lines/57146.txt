I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Why were you given notice?
They're not obliged to tell.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
You don't believe that.
I wouldn't put it past him.
