Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
