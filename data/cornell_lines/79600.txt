Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
