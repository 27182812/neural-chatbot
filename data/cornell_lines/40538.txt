--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
I got lured.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
