Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
I'm afraid not.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
When?
We'll let you know.
