When did it start?
The first reports came in at about ten.
Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Impossible, I don't believe it.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
