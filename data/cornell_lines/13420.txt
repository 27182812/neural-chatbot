My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
