You... surprised me.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Yeah.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
What?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Look...
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know...
Excuse me?
You know, you ever think about other women?
