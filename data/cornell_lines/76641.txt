You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
His face.
Does he have hair?
Yes.
Is it long and hanging down?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.

Go on to the next question.
That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
