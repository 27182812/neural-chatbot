There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Thank you, but I can wait.
I can't.
