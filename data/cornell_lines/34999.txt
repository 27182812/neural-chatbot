Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
Mr. Dobisch said that?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
That's very flattering.
