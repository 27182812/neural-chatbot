I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
