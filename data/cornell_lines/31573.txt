Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
What was?
The stuff we got last night.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Don't get funny with me again.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
