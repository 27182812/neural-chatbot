Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Who might these friends be?
Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
