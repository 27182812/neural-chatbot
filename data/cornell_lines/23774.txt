This is Wednesday.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Wrong day?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
