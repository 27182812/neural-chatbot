Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
Thank you.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
I'm supposing.
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
