Hi, Ma.
I've been calling and calling.
I got caught up at work.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
I brought you flowers.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You're gonna cheer up.
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
He paid for 'em.
