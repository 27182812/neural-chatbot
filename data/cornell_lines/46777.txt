It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
On what evidence?
None.  Call it a hunch.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Do you have any proof?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
