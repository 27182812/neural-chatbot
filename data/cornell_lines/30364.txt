You're in Oklahoma?!
Not yet.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Can't it go to any office?
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
