Are you a private detective?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Three hundred?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Up front?
Half now, half later.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
