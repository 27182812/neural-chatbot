No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Flynn?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
Cute.
End of line.
