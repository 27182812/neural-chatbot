Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
