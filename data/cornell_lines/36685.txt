So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
Catherine told me what was in it.
If she's telling  you the truth.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
