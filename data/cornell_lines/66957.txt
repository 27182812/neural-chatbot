How did you know?
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Because that's what I would have done...
