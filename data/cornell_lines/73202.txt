Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
