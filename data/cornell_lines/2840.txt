Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Thank God.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
