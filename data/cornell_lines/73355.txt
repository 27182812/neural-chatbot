...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
