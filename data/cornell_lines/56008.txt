No, we'll go through here.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes.  It's faster.
No,  I'm not going through there.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
