How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
I want you back, Fran.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Important?
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
