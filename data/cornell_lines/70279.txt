Go home.
May I see my mother?
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has confessed.
No.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
