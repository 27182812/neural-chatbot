Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?

I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
