Which one is yours - the big one?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
No, my flag steward.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
I'm not interested at all.
Well, I'm not.
That's very interesting.
