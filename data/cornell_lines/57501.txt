Huh.. .Hello?
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Ha!  You tell me.
