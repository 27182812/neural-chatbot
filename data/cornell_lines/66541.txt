Some people are very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
It doesn't bother me either.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
I don't think you're a bum.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Morning after?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...Guess.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
