I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
At least you walked.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
You didn't do that badly.
