Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Not at the moment.
Why not?
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Very well put.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
