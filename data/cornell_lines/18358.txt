My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
