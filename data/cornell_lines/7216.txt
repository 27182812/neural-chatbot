I want my man back.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Never mind that, I want my man!
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
You don't own this man!
I want him back!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
