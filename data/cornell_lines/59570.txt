This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
