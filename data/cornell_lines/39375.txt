It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
