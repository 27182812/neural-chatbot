I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
