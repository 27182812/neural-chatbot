Don't, Beth.
But I have to, Norman.
I promise --
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Beth --
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's either this... or I kill you.
