So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
With much bloodshed.
I am afraid.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
He is a capable man.
