...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Elvis?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Pick me up in five minutes.
