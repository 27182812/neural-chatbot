Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
She's my daughter, Tom.

So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
