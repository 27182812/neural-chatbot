Come now. Did you see the gun?
I can describe it.
Oh really?
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
You can't remember that -- !
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
How can you remember that?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Ah.
