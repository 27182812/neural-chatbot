You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
