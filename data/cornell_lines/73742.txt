Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Who gets it, the company?
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
So where is all them half-centses?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
