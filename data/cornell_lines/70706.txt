You going to call the police?
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
Shave our legs, stupid.
