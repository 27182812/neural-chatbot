What can I say, Jack?
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
You look awful.
Thank you.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
What about the zoo?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
I want you to meet some people.
