I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.

And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
