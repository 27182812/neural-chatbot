Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
What sins have you to confess?
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
That's a pretty big sin.
I know.
You should think about this.
I know.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Alright.
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
