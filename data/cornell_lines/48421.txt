Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
It’s me, Jack...
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
How’d you know my name?
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
I never won anything in bowling.
