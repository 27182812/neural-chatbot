I didn't do anything.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
I don't know a loud crash.
And what about screaming?
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
What's this, how did this happen?
