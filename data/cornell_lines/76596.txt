Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
