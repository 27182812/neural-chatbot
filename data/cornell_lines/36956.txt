I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.

Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
