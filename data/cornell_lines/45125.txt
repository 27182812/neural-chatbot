See, I'm going home.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
No. None of that.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
