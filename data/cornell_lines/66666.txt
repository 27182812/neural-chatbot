Yo, Paulie.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Yo, Paulie.
What?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Looks, huh?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Hey --
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
...Adrian ain't sharp.
