David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.
I would.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I can't do that --
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I can't leave when I'm so close.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
That's absurd --
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
