How do you mean?
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
The poem?... The poem was great!
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
What?
