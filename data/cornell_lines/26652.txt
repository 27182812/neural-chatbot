Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
It is.
What exactly is he charged with?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
