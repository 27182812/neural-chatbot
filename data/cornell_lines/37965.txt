Jesus.
It ain't what you think.
You don't know what I think.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Leave off..
She was only-
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Who is she? Where she come from?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
