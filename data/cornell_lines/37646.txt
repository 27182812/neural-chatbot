Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
He does...?
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
