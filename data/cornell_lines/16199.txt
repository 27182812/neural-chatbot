This smells good.
Why am I such an authority?
Here comes the resume.
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
