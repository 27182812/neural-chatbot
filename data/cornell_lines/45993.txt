Go away, assface.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!

Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Captain Rob came back?

Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
