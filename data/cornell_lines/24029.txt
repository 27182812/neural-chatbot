Is this what it's like to love somebody?
You disappointed?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
What?
You smell like baby powder.
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
It is for me too.
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
