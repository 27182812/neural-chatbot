Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
