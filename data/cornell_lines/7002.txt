So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Yeah.
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I was just being honest.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Her name is Gretchen.
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
