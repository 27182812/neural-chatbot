Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
But, why must you confront him?
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
