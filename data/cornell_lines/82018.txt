If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
What way is that?
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Well... that, too.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
