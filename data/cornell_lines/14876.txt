Comfortable?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
It still sounds high.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
