This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
