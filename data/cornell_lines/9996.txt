Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
What do you mean?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Huh?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I didn't check my messages...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Help me what?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
