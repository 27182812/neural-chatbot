Oh, God!
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh, wow!
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Oh, who cares?
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
