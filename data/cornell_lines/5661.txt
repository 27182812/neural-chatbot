What's happened to you?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
Different? How?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Yeah?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
