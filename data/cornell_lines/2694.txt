Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
