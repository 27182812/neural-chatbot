Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
I... no, I... I just can't...
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
