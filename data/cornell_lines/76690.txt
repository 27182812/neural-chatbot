When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
No.
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
