You brought your kids?
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
You're a good mother.
