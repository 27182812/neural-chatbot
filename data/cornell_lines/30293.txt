Well, where are you from?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Of course you don't know.
Why "of course"?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
