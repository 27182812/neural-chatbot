Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I would start with cocktails.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
