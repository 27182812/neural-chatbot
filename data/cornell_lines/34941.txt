Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.
Would you like to?
Sure.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
You mean tonight?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
No. Like a man.
