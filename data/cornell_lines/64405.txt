In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
