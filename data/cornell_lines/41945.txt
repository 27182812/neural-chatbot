Mornin'.
Is this your establishment?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
....-lene.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Iced coffee.
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...dangerous.

...deer.
I beg your pardon?
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I assume you have one.
Assumptions are always dangerous.
