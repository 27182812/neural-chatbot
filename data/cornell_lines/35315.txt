Did you catch Corbett?
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
Was there any trouble?
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
