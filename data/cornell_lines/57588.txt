The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.

Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
