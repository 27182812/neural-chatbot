So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Recruited you from where?
National Marksman Competition.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
You don't like New York?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
You'd never been out of New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
How did you like Toronto?
It was okay.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Is there something wrong with that?
I'm not sure.
