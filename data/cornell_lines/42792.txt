Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
Been punished, yeah?
I've been cured.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Long time, is right. I don't remember them days too horrorshow. Don't call me Dim no more, either. Officer, call me.
