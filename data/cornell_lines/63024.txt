Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Did she always have nightmares?
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
I'm serious.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
I'm sure you would.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
I'll need to take her things.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
