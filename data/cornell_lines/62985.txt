At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
