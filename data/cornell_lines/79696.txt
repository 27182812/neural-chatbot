Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
