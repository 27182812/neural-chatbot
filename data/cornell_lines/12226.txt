Good way to lose your job.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
You always were hard to impress.
