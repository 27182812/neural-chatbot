Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
