Have you fantasized about me?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Yes.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
No.
On tape?
No.
Why not?
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
Can't or won't?
