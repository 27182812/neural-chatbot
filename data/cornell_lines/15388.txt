So, what do you think we should do?
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
So that's cool with you, then?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Whose idea was it?
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
