Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I need a new PR guy.
