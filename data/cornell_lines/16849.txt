I wish you had told me then.
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
What would you be doing now?
Getting high, I guess.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
