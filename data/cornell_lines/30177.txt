I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
You sure you know where to find one?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
And what does that mean?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
