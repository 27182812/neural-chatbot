You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?

Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Who?
