Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
What?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
