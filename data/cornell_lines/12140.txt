She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
It's a great song.
Thank you.
