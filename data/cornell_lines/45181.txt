I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
What are you, God?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What are you, hoping?
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
What do you think?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Forget Sal.
What do you mean?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
Forget Sal?
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
Merle...
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
