C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Why would she want that?
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
