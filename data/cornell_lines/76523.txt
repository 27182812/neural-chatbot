Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
Los Angeles?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
I’m sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldn’t let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until you’re told otherwise.  And for what it’s worth, I wouldn’t try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. I’d sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
