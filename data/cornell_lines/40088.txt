I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
No.  Not even you.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
