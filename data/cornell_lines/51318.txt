I bet you can't guess what happened?
What?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Why?
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
