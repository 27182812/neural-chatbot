Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
