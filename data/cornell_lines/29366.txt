Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Do I sound foolish to you?
No.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Yes.
I wish I could be that way.
