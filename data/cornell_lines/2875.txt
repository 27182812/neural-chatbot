Where am I?
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
We won, Austin.
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
