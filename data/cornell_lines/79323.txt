Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
