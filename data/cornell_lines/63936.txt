I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
You might not have a choice.
