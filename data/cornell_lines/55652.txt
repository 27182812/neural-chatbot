She's swell.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Uh-huh.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmmm . . .
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Hmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm . . .
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Hmmm?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
No.
Well then, how do you know?
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Oh . . .
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
And all's fair in love and war?
