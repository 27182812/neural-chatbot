Oscar wants you to call him.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
With Jennifer.
And where'd you go?
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Why do you want to do that?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Mm.
