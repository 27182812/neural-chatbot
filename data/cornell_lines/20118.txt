I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Is that the question?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
