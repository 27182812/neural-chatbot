How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
