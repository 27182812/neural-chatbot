Hi.
I heard you might be moving back...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
Goodbye. I lov...
