That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Don't you care about what's happened?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
There must be an answer somewhere.
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
