I want to go home.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
What?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
