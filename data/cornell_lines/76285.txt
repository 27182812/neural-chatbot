Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
You really think so, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
They don't say it to me.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Sure.
Let's get in your truck.
