Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
