Something like that.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
You live around here?
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Were you watching me?
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
I have to go.
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
