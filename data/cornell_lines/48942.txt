Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, I see.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?

Ma'am, I answered your question.
