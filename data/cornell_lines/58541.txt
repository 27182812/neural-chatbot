The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
I got to go.  I'm late.
Call me tomorrow.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
A couple of weeks.
One question.
What?
Who is she?
