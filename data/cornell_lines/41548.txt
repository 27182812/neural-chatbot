Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
That's the spirit.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
But no one actually saw him die.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Oh. Then who's this one?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Me? Why me?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Agents.
