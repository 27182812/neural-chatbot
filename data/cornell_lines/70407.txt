Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
What about me?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Karl is a guy guy?
