They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Trust me, you won't have to.
