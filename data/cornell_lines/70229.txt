Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
My suitor?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
He has proposed to me twice.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
