No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
