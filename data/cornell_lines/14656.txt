Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What'd ya mean?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
What?
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
