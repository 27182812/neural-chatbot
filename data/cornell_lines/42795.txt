I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Thank you, sir.
My wife... Alex freezes.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
No. She's dead!
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Yes. They want to help.
Help me, sir?
Help you.
Who are they, sir?
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
