What type of planes do you have?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
