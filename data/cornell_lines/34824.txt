Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
I trust you.
Oh Soph...
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
And the food sucks, I know.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Well good.  Thank God.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Oh honey, let's.
