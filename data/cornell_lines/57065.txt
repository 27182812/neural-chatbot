He's fucking nuts.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
Doesnit sleep?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
He wets the bed?
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
