Walter.
Do you have many friends?
No.
How come?
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
It sounds like you were banished.
Banished... yeah.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Robin?
Yes?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
