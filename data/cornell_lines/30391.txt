So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
