Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I'm sorry.
I need you to get me Paula --
You want her right now?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
