<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i>
