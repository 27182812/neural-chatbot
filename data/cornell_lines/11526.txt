It's your money. You talk.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Yeah.
You making a feature?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.
