I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I assume you want something?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
