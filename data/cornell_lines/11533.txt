You're not a private detective either, are you?
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Jesus.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
And your wife? Where's she?
She's dead.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
