Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
Pardon me?
