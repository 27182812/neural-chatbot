You think about it?
Yeah.
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
The shot?
Fucking A.
I don't think about the shot that much.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Yeah... I guess.
What do you think about?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
