All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
To all those cons...
Searching for a money man...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
-- till he fucked his parole --
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
