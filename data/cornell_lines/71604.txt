Nothing.
Too late for what, Sheila?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
You got any broken bones?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I can't tell you, Theo.
Why not?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
He's my father.
