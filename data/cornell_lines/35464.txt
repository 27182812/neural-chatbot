Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
