Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
You are my friend.
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle —-
Listen to what I say --
When you make sense I'll listen.
