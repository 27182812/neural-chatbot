Look.  I know they hate me.
They don't hate you --
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
