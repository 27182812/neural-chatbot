Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Are you for real?
Touchy, touchy!
