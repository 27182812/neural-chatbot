Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
But I got a train to make.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
But what about all these other people?
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
