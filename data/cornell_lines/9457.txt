No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
No, my lord.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Yes, my lord.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
