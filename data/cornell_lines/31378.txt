But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Its tires are flat...
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
We got a plan!
