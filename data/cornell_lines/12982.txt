What are you doing in there?
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm sorry about my parents.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Do you?
Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
