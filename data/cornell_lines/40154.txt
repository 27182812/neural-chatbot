What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
