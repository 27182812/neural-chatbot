George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
No more brothers, Diego.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
You fucked me, Diego.
I did not.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
