Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
To cover up?
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
