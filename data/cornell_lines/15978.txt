Peter...
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
You don't understand.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
It's not that easy.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
But I do.
Why?
Because she killed herself!!
