Did you see the van back there?
What van?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Realized what?
Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
