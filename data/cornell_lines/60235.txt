Have I told you what this man did?				*
Yes.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
