Yield *how*, sir?
Will he yield for a question?
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
For a *question*.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
It does!
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
Mr. President--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I have no defense against forged papers and--
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
