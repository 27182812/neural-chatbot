Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
This isn't a date.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
The Rex.
Any good?
I think you'll approve.
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Thank you <u>very much</u>.
