How was your evening?
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
