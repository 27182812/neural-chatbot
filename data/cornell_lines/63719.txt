You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Sure we keep records!
Well, where are they?
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
That's all. Next witness!
