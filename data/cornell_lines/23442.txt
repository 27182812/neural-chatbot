I have a proposition.
You always do.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
That's enough.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Good day, Marquis.
THEN BUGGER ME!
