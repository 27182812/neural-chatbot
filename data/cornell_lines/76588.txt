I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
And when was that?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
