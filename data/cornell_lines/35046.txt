Good evening, Baxter.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc.
