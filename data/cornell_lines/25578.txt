Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Rae, I need help.
Why come to me?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
What's stopping you?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
What makes you think I could?
Why would they stop you?
Because I'm your sister.
