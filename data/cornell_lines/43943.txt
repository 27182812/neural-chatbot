You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
