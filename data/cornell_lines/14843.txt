This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
What do I do?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Okay.
Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
