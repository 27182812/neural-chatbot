What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Why would he do that?
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
I won't talk first.
