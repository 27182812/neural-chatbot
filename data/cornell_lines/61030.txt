You're going to use Walter?
He's our guy.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
He won't be back in a hurry?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Sure.  If the main character does.
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
