Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
