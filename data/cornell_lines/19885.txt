I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
