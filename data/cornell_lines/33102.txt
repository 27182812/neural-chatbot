Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Y'what?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
I'm a deserter.
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Yeah.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What they like?
