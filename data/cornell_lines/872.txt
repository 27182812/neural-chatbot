Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
