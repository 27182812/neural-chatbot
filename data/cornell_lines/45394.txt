Well -- what are we going to do?
We can still use my butter money.
Your butter money?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary -- it's gone.
Not all of it?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
