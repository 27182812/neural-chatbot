So, we call them... IMGs.
Infant Memory Generators.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
