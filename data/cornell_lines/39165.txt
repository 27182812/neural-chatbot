I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
That wasn't the deal.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
