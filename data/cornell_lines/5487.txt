I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
If you say so.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Some women like Dobermans --
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
