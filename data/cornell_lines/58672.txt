Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.

You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.

You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
You killed my parents.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
