We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Oh.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
I don't think I remember him.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
Who?
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.
