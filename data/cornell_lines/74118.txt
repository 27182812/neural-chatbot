Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I guess they are a little odd.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Oh.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
It must feel great.
It's not bad.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
How much do you weigh?
195 pounds.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
What about it?
Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
