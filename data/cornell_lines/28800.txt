Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
