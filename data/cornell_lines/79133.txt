Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
Yes or no.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
My husband can't know about this.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
I think so.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
I can do it!
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
Natasha?
No.  Doris.
