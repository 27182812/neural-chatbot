Nobody told me.  I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
