I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
