Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
That boy wants me to.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
