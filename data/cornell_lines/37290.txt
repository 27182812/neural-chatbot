David, David, David ...
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
