There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
That ain't right.
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
