Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
I don't have it with me...
Bullshit!
I swear...
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
A post office box.
