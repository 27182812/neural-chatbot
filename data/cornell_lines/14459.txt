You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
No.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
