How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was a man though... right?
The police think he was high on drugs...
