Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
No, he's working on another book.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
I didn't know that.
Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
