What about your knocking off for lunch?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
