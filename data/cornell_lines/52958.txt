I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Why?
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
But not over me?
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Poor Hannah.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
I can't say anything!
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
