What?
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Like this place?
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
