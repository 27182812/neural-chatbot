I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
[You tell me.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[What does the file say?]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
