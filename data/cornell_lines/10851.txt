Thank you very much, sir.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
I know.
Ben, can I say something to you?
What?
How long have we known each other now?
