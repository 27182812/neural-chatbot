Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Where'd they go?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Are you a spirit too?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
I want to get in.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
I think so.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Yeah.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Yes.
Of course you do.
