Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
They got heat in Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is heat.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
I'll get right on it.
