A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
A play, dummy.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
So?
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
And now he will?
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
