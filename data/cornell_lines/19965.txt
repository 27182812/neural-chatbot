You came home last night - without them.
I did what!
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
What two policemen?
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
