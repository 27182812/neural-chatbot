Morning.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Enjoy.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
What?
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Which one is Elijah again?
The monkey.
Yeah. Okay.
