Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Whose number do you need?
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
