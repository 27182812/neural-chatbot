She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage.

Not feeling too bad now are you?
No, sir, I feel really great.
Good.

Priest rises and moves to Alex.
