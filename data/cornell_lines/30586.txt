Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
No.
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
You can't be serious.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
