Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
No.
Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this.  "Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?" or "You came in that thing ? You're braver than I thought".
