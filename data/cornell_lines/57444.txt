After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
What?
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
