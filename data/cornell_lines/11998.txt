How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?

Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
We'll do it next Monday.
Well what's the point in that?
