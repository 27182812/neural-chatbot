Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
You're hearing about somebody else.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
You don't know how wrong you are.
