I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
She will succeed.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Yes, of course.
