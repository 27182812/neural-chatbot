I can run out and get it.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
I can't be staying long anyway.
How long then?
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
You a blue-moon fool.
Then we'll do something else.
What else?
Trust me.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Trust me.
