Stay away from me...
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
No...
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
Who?
I hate him.
Agnes, who did this to you?
