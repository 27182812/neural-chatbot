All I want is one more week.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
You have proof?
I'll have it.
When?
Next week.
