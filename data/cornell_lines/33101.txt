Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Nine.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Eight and two thirds.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Shurrup!
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
