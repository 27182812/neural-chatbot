I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
