You drive like a maniac!
I call this the staccato.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Oh yeah?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
