Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
