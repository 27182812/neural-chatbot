Yeah.
What's happened is freak luck.
Freak luck for sure.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Freak luck is a strange thing.
