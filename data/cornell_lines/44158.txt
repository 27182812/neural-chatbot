Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Okay.
Did you hide the letters?
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Why?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
You'd do that for me?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Best friends.
