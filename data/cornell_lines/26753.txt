No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
