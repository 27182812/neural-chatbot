...Are you a tranz or a rez?
Excuse me?
Transient or resident?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
