Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
You've been bitten by bats?
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
You have chills?
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
