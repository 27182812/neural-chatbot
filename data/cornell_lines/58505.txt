Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
What's the difference?
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
