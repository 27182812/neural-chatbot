Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Nepal? Have you been?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
You own a home there?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
