Sure you don't want to come with me?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I sure hate to go alone...
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
You don't have to.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
What do you mean?
My work may take me out of New York.
