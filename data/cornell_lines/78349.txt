I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
Like a veil has been lifted?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Like muddy waters?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
You were in hell?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Do you think you won?
It was nip and tuck.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
