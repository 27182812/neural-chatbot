Marry Christmas.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
What gave you that idea?
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I forgive you.
You shouldn't.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
Cheers.
