Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
It doesn't look all that different.
The future doesn't look different?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
What about the world?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
