I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
How is she?
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
Is it because of Anna?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
How old is Anna?
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
