What d'you say, Elaine?
Not much -- you?
Same.
Uh-huh.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Probably.
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Really.
Didn't get it.
Well, those are the breaks.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
You just cooking then?
Hell, no.  I started writing.
