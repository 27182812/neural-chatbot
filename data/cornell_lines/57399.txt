Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Why does he decide?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Like a principal?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
I don't understand, daddy.
What don't you understand, pal?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Where will my toys be?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Who will read me my stories?
Your mom.
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
