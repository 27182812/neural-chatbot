No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
