God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
Yeah.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
You always threw up.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
He was just having fun.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
You could've come.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
You're making things up, Frank.
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
