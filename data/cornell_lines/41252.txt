Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
Who are you?
Let me talk to the lady again.
There's no lady here.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Hold on.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Let her tell you.
