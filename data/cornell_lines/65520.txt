I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
