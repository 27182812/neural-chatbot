Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
All right. The truth?
I'm all ears.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
You want the details?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Noon tomorrow...?!
