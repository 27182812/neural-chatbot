I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Me?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
No. Bob did.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Anthony, I'm petrified.
