Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Rachel's job is she works.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy?
What honey?
If you want me to hate her I will.
