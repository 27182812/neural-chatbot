You look a little shaken.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
No, I have my things in the car.
Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
