Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
