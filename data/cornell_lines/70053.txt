Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Like what?
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
You son-of-a-bitch!
