You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
I don't know what you've been saying.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Do what?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Shut up!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Leave me alone!
...Forty thousand dollars!
Leave me alone!
