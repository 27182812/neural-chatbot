Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Yeeees?
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
There aren't hotels?
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
And what did you say?
I said I'd check with you.
