Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
You're leaving?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is that a boat?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Yep.
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
