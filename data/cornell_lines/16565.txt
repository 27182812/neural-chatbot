We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
Oh, yes...
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
And then?
Yes?
What will become of me then?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
I see...
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
I don't expect you'd understand.
My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
