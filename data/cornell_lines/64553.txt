You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Something like that.
Do you take risks?
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Not unnecessary ones.
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
