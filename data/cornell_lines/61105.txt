Snap out of it!
I can't!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
What?
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
What are you talking about?
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Alright. Where's the Met?
