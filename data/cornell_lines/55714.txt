I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
