Yeah, that works out.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Yes.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
