Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Did my brother go back?
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
You're right.
Tom, what do I do now?
