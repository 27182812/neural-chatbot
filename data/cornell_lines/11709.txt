Will they really teach me to shoot?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
Well, I don't...
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
What's the chance of getting one of these?
