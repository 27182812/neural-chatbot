I see where you're going.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?

Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.

Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
