For instance, something like this?
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
