I'm sorry, Claudia.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
You wanna go on a date with me?
Please, yes.
Well...is that illegal?
No.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Really?
Yeah.
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
