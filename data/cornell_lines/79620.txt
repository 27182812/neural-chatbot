Hey!  You there!
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Christ no!
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
