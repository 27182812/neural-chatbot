Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
What?  They ain't there?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Okay, sure, Mick.
Caesar, you still got the money?
