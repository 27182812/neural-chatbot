I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You mean you blew it.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
