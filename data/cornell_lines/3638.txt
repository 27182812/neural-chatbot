Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
I have acted as I think fit.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Neither!
