I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
Think nothin' of it.
