Waddaya gonna do now?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
You want me to ride down with you?
What for?
It's early.
It must be one o'clock.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
