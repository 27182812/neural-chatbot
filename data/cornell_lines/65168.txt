I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
So-so.
Who's the girl?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Nice.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Why should I mind?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
