Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
JTS...?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Are you an artist?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
