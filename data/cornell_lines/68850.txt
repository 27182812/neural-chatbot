You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
No.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Good.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
