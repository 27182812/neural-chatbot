I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Who?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Oh, Jesus ...
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
