However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
A job?
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
I'd like that.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
The people at the restaurant?
Yes.
