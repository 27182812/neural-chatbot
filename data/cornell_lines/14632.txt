Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
