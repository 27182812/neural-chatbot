I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
I thought the subject was sex?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Yes.
How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Why not?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
Try.
