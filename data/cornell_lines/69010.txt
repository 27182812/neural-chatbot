Talk!
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Keep talking.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
And maybe you lie...
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
