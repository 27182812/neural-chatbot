Are you sure you weren't followed?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
I understand.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
