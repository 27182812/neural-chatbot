Nothing.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
What do you mean?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
From who?
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
