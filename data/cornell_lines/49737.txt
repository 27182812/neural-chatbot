I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
Then don't go out with me.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Just get the fuck outta here.
