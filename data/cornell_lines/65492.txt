Aw, don't... no...
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
