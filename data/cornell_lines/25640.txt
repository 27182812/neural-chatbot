Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Better late than never.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
You really think so?
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Soon.  Soon.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Everyone you know is lying.
That's true.
