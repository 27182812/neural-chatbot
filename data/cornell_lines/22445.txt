Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
You know what happened.
No, I don't.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
And what do they know?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
That's right.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
