Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
My history.
Yeah.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
I'll be.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
