Did you kill anyone?
I don't like to talk about that.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
No.  I could have, though.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Can't today.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
All righty.  I understand.
