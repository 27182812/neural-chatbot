I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
Perhaps the fall...
There's one other thing. I feel..
What?
...Afraid.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
...A bat.
What?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
