He said that, huh?
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.
Well, how about it?
About what?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
What for?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Jesus!
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
