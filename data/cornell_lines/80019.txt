He's gonna die, ain't he?
Maybe.
Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
That ain't what I mean.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
An' if I spot 'em?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Just like that?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Yeah?
Hell, yeah.
