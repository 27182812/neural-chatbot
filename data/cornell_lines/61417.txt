We're going to lose.
You can't know that for sure.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Who?
Mrs Brown.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
What's her excuse this time?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
