Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
What?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Oh for Christ's...
