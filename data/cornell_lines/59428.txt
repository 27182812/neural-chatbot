Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
