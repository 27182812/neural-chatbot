Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
You weren't so bad yourself.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Next week "East Lynne."
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I refuse to resign!
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
