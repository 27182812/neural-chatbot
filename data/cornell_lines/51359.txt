What the hell are you talking about?
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
No strings.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.

Do you gamble?
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Do you owe markers?
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
