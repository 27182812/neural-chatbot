What's goin' on?
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
