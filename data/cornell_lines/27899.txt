I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole’ me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don’t show up for my physical on time!
It'll serve you right.
