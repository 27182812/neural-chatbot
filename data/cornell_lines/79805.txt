...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
