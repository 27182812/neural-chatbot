You want my number?
I do.
Which number do you want, George?
You got more than one?
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Ten?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
You got a little girl?
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
