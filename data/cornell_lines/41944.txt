Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...-fall.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
But...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...screwup?
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...noon.
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...scientists.
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Where's their protective...
...gear?
It's a hundred degrees...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
They'll get a break tomorrow.
