Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
What do you mean, dear?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
