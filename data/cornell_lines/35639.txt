Who is that other guy?
Another contractor.
Someone hired both of you?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
So this is something between you and him?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Why?
Because he is trying to retire me.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
Why?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
And you want to use me to get him?
Yes.
Forget it!
We don't have a choice.
