Excuse me.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
Huh.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
How do you know that?
You told me.
When?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Really?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Sorry.
