_ Your father raped someone?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Yes.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
You're the killed.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
