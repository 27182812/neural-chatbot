M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Slept like a rock.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
No.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You believe in anything?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
