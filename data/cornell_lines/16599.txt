We must follow that bird.
Whatever for?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Beware.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
