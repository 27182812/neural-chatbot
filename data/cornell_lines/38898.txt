I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
Yes, it is.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let us drive.  We have much to talk about.
