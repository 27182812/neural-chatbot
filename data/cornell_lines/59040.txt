No.

It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
