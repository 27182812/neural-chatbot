JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
You shouldn't touch her.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
What did you do to Buzz?
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
I don't want to play.
