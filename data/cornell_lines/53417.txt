Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?

My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
