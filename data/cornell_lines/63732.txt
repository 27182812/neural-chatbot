River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
That's right... .
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Mm—hmm.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Mm—hmmm.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Maybe.
