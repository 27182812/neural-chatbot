Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
At night?
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
