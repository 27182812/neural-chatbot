I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
Give me the gun.
The gun! ... I lost it
You're sure?
No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
