YOU SHUT UP!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You sayin' you'll do what?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
