What is it?
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
You're right.
