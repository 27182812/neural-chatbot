Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
