The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.

Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.

India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Britain?
Britain chooses not to.
And, America?
America, we shall see.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
