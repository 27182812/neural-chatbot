Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
What numbers do you punch?
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
I aim to kill you with it.
