There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Thank you, Number One.
