Sidney. Hello. How are you?
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's good to see you involved.
My morn was a Delta.
