Who?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Please, call me Gale.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
