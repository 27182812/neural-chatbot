I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Yes.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
