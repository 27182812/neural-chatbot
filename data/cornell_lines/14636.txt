I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
