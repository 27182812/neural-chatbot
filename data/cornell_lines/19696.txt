I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
Splendid.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I'm splendid, too.
That's--that's splendid.
And how's your bill, Senator?
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Well! You don't say!
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.

Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
