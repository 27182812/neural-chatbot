....no....
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
...just talking to you....
Are your pants off?
No.
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Really?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
Really?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
It doesn't matter.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
No.
You have a girlfriend?
...yes...
Where is she?
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
