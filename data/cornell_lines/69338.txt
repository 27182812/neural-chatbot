Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes, thanks.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
And you like it?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Well, yes.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
