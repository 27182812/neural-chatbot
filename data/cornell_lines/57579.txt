I want to go down there.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
You cannot.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
I would not know. Maybe.
