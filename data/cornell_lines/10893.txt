Why do you look at me like that?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
And then --?
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
And -- and --
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
So alone.
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man...
Am I quite strange to you?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
And...?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
Go away. Who are you --?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
Yes -- I do understand.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Just for a minute then.
