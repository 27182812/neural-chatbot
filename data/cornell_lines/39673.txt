It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
You could do that?
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
