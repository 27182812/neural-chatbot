Are you from Washington originally?
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Oh. When did you move back?
After the divorce.
Oh.
How long you been married?
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
No, really?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
