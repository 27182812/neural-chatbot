Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Yeah right.
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Please.
