Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
You talked to his wife?
