We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
Okay...we got it together....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
The shark will get it for us.
