As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
I'll walk you out.
