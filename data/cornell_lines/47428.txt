Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
You come to the right place.
I guess I did.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
