I was telling the truth.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
He might be.  I don't know.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
