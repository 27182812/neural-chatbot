What kind of question?
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
