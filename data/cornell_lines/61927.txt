Why not now?
What do you mean?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
You leave your father to me.
