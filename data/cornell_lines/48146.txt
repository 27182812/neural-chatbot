Actually, that's my stage name.
I'm sorry?
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Blanche.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Well, that's fine --
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Right.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
