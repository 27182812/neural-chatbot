Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Yes, sir.
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
