Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
I'm thirty-seven years old.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
And we'll sell the house.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
No. He don't.
