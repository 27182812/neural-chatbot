Get out of this room and get back to work.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
