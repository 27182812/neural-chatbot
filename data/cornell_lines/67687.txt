Did you call that radio station again?
No.
Everyone at work heard you.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
It's a short word.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
