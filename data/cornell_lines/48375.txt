Her assistant?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
You?  Married?
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her?  Just like that?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
