How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
This is your ship?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
El Capitan?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
