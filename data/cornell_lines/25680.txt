Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Hello, Hal.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
You never were together, Hal.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Clyde.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
