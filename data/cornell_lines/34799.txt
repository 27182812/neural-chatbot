Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Do Peter Sellers again.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Yeah.
Would you, like, marry him?
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Very.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
