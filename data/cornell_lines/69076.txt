I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
It wasn't much of a letter...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
It isn't fair...
