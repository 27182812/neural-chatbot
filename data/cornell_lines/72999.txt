Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
Yes?
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
