Thanks.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...maybe...
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
You better pay the man.
