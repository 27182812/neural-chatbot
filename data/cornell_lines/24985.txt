Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
I guess.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Yes.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
Do you want to leave therapy?
Not really.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Yes.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
