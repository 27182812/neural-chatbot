When are you going back?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
It'll have to be sex, then.
