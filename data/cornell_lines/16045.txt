I don't think you'll grow careless.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
How did you know I had sons?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
I know you.
