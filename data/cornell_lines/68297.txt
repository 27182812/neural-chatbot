One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
It kind of looks that way.
Pistols?
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
