I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Yessir, I can see that.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Uh, yessir.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ready for anything.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Gonna be like money from home.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
