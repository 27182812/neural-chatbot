J. S. Bach.
Jim West.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Funny.  So am I.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
