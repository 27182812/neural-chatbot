Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
I'm trembling with excitement.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
That's refreshingly deviant.
What about you?
I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I see.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
