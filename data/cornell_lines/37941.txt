That girl...You know, Beloved...
Yes?
She gone like they say?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
