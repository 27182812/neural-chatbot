You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
You look awful.
Thanks.
Really.  You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Seeing anyone in particular?
Why the interest?
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
