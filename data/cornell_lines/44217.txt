The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
What's your plan of attack?
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
But who will they turn to for help?
