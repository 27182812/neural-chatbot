You know the main staircase in the opera?
Yes.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Yes.
Then you go into the foyer.
Yes.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
I know that niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
I remember.
You like that statue?
Not particularly.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
