Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
-- never in a million girl --
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
You love her?
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Got hit twice.
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
For real?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
True?
Like a mafucka.
That takes some of the sting out.
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
What were you doin' here anyway?
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
