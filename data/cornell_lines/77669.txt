But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Oh! You didn't read it!
Naturally I did.
Oh!
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
M'sieu Laval!
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
What's wrong now?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
What shade of powder do you use?
Peaches and cream.
That's too dark.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
