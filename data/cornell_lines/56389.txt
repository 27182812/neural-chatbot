As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
