No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I'm so cold.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
I can't feel my body.
Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
