I want to report a wrongful arrest.
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Yes.
Is it stamped?
Stamped?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Where do I get it stamped?
Information Adjustments.
