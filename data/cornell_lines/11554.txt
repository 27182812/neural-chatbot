This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
What have you found out?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Where is she?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
That's like a stag film.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
No.
They're legal now.
They are?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Hmm.
There's a little stall theatre up here.  It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see.
