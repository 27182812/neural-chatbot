I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
If you graduate.
You're gonna flunk me?!
