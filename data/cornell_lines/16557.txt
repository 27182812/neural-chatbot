My generosity is not so large as that.
What do you want with me?
Your love.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
But I'm hideous!
You're magnificent.
Grotesque... monstrous...
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
