Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Oh-
This is the first book that I got you.
