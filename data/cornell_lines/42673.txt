What the hell are you doing here?!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Look, I know--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
I did what I thought was right.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
There wasn't time for anything else.
We'll never know, will we?
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
