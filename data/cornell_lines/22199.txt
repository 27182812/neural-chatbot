Asshole.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Where did you get this clown?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Different tables.
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
