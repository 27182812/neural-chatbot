Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
This is his assertion.
Where are they now?
