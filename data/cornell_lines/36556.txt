I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
