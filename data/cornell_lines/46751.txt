Damnit... <u>What</u>?
I want you to follow Bud White.
Even I'm not that crazy.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
You make a mistake?
Yeah.  My whole life.
