Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana, sir.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Cabana one.
One.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I would, actually.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I recommend it.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Very good, sir.
