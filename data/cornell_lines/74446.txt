I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
If the stores are open -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
I made you write a beautiful song...
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
