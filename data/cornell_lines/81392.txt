You dropped a glass.
I...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
In the living room...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
What's wrong with me?
