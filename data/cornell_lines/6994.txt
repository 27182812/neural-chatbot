People get hurt.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
But you were punished.
Yes. I went to jail.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
