When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
You are the same?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes.  Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
