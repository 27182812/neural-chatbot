Back to California
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Huh?
What things made you so sure?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Well, don't they?
Sure.
