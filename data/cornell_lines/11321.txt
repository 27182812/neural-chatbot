You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Tell them yourself!
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
I didn't tell you everything.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
This room is full of ghosts.
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
