One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
I want to keep my teeth.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted.

Bobo, no, I --
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --

My son was in the hospital --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?

Motherhood.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You expect me to buy this?
