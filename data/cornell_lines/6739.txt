Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Thank you.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
