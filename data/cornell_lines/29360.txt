They're gone. The same pattern.
But they'll be back.
We won't be here.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
They won't be.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
I started to say... inside...
You don't have to.
