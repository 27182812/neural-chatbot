What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
Me more than most.
Why are they ganging up against me?
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
How did they threaten you?
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Good kids.
