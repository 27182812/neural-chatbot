Why aren't you at work?
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
