Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
