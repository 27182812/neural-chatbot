I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
Duquette.  Forget him...
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
And you believe her?
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
