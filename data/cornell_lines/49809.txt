Is there anything particular you're looking for?
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
That's it?
That's it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I guess not.
He'll be so relieved.
