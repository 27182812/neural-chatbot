Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Where did you here that?
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
