I work there but I'm really a stranger.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
And what did they say about me?
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
