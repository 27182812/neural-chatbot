You out to buy a motel?
No.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
Oh.
