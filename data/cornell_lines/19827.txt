You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Sure.
With pay!  She is out the door.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
