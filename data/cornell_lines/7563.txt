I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Egad, were you horrified?
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
