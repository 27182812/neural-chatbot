Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
I don't.
