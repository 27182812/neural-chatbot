What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Six duds in a row.
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
