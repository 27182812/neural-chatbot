I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
They could see that I meant it.
You're kiddin' me.
No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
