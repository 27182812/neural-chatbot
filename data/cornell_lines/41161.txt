I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
