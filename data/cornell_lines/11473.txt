Did you see him?
Yeah.
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
Is he coming home?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
The park!
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
You figure!
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
A what?
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
How nice.
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
