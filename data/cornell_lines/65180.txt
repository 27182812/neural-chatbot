My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
It's fine, thank you.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
