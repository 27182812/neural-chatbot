You're nervous again.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
You were afraid of heights?
Terrified. Still am.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Aren't we all.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
