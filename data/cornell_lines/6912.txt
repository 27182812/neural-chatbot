So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Theoretically.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
So... that's it?
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
