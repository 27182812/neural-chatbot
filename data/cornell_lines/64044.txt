Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
Really?
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
I know what you're talking about.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Of course not.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
It's a big house.
