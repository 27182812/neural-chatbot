Looking good out there.
Thanks.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Yeah. Like that.
Good.
