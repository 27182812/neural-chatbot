Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
You could've hit me.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
You wouldn't --
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Stop talking like that!
Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
