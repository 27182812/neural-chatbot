Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
I owe you something.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Well, if you put it that way...
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
