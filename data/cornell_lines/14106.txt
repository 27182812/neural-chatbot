Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Well, what do you really think, though?
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
