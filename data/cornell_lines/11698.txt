Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
And why is that?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Just give me a rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Fifteen.
A rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
