You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
