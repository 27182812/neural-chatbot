She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
How deep does this go?
I don't know.
