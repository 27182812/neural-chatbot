Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
1952...?
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
