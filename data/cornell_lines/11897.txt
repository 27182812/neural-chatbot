This is what began it.
A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
What kind of doors?
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Hell...
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You're still afraid.
You would be. They tore me apart.
So you were cheated.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
