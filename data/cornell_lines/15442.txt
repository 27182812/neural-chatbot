Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Junk?
You know... it's parts...
I know what junk is.
Yeah?
We definitely want it to have junk.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
