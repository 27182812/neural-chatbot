Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Over the water department, or over you?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Then it was over the water department.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Oh, yeah?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Never forgave him for what?
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
You sure shout that?
Of course I'm sure.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
