Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
