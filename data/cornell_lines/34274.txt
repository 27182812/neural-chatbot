Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
A la votre.
