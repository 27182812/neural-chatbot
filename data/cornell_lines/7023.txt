Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
