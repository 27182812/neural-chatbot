Well, not exactly.
You been with a girl ever?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I think so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
I swear.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
You do that.
