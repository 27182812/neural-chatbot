Get up out of the chair, Richard.
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Get up!
