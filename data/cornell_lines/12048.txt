Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Yeah, sure...
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
