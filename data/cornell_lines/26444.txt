But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
Even Joey Venza?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
What about when she identifies him?!
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
