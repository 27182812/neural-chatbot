Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!

I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Yes sir.
