Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Yeah.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
Dreadful.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Well --
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
We need all our fuel.
