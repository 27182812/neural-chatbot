What do you want me to do?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
