What is it, Claudia?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Does it please you to say such things?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Then why do you say them?
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
