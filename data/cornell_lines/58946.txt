Is this boyfriend bothering you?
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
-- is not my boyfriend.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
It's not -- what's a 422?
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
You won't.  You won't have to.
But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
