I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
