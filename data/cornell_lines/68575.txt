Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
