Does he know you think he's real?
He is real.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
