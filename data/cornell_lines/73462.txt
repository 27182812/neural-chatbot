How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Uh-huh.
