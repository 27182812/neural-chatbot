Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
It's disgraceful!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Ye-es?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
The same thing.
You're hired!
