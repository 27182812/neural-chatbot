It's about the leopard.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
No. I'm quite sure.
