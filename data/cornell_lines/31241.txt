Not talk!  I said TALK!!
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
It was implanted by the Agency.
And falling in love?
Implanted.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Bullshit.
