Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
I did.
Why?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
