This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
I was on call.
I want you on call here.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
He's sick.
For a change.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
