It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Yes, I suppose so.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
