Seating problems.
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
What kind of seats can we have?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Take care of those chairs.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Maybe.
