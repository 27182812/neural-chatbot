I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
You think it's that good?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
