Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Much better, thank you, sir.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Fine, sir, fine.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Thank you very much, sir.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, shall we get down to it?
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
