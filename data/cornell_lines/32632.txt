You don't know?
Know what?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
No.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I was asleep.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I went to bed around seven.
