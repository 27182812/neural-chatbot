Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
