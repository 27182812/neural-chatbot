Where?
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Where are you going?
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
I know.
He owns it. You know?
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
You didn't tell me.
There hasn't been a lot of time.
