The dynamite...
Dynamite?
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
This is... really a shock...
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Who do you think could've done this?
I'll ask the questions, son.
