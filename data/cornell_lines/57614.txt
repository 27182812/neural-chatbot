I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
And what would he do come winter?
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
