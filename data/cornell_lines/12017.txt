Hey.
What the fuck is that?
My band.
What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
