Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Have you been noticing anything strange?
No, why?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
What taxi driver?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
How long has he been there?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
