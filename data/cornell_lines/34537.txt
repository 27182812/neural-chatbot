No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
It relaxes me.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Oh, come, you don't need that.
