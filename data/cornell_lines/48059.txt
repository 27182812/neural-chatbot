Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
I hate your kids, Frank.
You're their uncle.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was an accident.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
Cindy.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
