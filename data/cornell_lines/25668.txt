I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
Why?
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
