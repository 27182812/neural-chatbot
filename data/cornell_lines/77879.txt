Where have you been hiding?
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
So you washed it off!
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by.
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Good-by!
There's soft music--
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
