The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
