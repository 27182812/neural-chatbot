Is it that funny?
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Is that how you feel?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You didn't say it.
I love you too.
