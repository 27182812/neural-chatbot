What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
