What do you want?
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
You do?
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
I love you.
What?
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
One more time would be nice.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
