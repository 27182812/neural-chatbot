Large?
All right, cop. I want my money.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Let me think about it.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
