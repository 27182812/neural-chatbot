Well?
God, you're beautiful.
Please. I look a mess.
No. You look so beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
I've moved on.
No!
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
That's not how he tells it.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Hunh.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
