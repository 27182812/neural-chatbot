Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
It could be.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
The old boy shot by the highway?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
That's very linear Sheriff.
