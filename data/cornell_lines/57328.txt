I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
Have you discussed this with them?
It's in the report.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
I wanted to give it to you first.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
All right.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Goodbye, Pete.
