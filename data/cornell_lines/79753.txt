Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
