Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Of course.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
I don't need your gratitude.
