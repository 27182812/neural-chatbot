Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Yes...
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
..."The Devil?"...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
