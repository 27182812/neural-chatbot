Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I called her up.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Alright.  Key?
