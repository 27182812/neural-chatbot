I could come with you.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
