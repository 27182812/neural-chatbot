Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
Yes, sir.
