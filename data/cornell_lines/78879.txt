You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
I did not.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.
I gotta sit down.
