That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
What about it?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Someone not his wife?
I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
