So where's the best place for mojitas?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Where's that?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
The Keys?
Havana.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
