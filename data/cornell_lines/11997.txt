What are you doing?
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
What's next?
Play it.
Say it.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
