Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Huh?
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
