They won't come anyway.
What do you mean, they won't come?
Why would they?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
God asked you to do something?
Yes... lots of things!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
What signs?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
No.  That was a sword in a field.
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
