Hey Charlie.
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Huh?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
