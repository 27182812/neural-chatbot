What do they--? Who are all those--?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Great.
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Must have been tickled pink.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Already? All these letters?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Second drawer.
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Not another bill?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate!
Do you want to dictate them?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Thanks a lot.
Oh--*Saunders*!
