What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Get up and dig.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Get up off your ass and dig!
