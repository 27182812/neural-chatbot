A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
For what?
A computer.
We've already got some.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
You designed it?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
What will it do?
Everything.
What will it get me?
Anything.
