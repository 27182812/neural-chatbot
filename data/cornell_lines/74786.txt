What are you doing?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Who?
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Slow down, take a breath...
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
What have they been doing to you?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
