Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
