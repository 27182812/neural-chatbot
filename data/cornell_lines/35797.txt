I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
So am I.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Yes.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Yes.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
That's my mum's.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
No!
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
No!
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Regards to Her Majesty.
