Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Kristina's fine.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Yeah.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
George, he wasn't asking.
