But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
C-connection?
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Telling you what?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Smack?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
