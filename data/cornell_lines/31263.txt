She wasn't really my wife.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Why would I lie to you?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Don't be ridiculous.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Inside what?
