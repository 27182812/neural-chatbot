Gentlemen--
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Who would do that?
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
You're firing me.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Bobby--
Fuck off.
