I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Who has?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
