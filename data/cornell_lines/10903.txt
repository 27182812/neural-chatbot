Suzette will be back here any minute.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
For Vienna?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Why later?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
