How long you think this'll take?
Twenty-four minutes.
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
