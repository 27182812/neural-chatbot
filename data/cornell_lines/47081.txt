It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
What do I do?
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
So I follow the wires?
You get Hardy.
I follow the wires.
