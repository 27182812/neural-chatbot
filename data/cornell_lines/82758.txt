I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
We're not after car thieves here.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
