Lazarus?
Oh! Gave me a start.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
You hurt it?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Well. It's good to see you.
