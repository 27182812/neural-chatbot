Lois, what are you doing?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Uh. . .
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
