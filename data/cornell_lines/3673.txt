Will we always leave it at this?
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
