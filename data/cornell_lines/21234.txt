Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Anything, Ninotchka.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
I promise... I swear.
Did you make any change in this room?
I don't think so.
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
