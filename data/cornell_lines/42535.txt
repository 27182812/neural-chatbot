Vermont?
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
FUCK!
Why'd you apologize?
What?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
I know.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I don't back down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
You know what pisses me off the most?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Because you buckled.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
You've got a customer.
