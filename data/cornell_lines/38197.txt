You don't want to go there.

Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
