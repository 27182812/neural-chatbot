Where's the news department at this studio?
It's upstairs.
Have you ever been there?
Sure, why?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Ok.
