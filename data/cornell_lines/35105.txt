Did you have a nice Christmas?
Lovely. You were a big help.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
It won't happen again.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
