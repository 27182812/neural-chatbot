You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Yeah!
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
What the hell could you do?
Day work.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
