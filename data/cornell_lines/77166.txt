I'm going to tell her.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects!  They won't come.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Who do you think did it?
Mimi...
Mimi!
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....
