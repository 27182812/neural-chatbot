You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
Huh?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
What's to sketch?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Broke is more like it.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Football in college.
You went to university?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Yes.  You were a Marine.
