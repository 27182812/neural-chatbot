I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
Where are you going?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You swear?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
But I've got school.
There's schools in California.
You swear?
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I don't believe you.
I swear.  On my life.
Swear on my life.
I swear on your life.
