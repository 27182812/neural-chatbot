Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
