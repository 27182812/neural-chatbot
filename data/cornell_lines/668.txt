So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.

Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Nothing.
