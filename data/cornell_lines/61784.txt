Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Great.
