Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
