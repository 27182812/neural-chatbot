Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
He's safe.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
