That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
How much?
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Of course not. Please.
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Five hundred.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
All right.
