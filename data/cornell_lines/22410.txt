Thank you.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
That is a separate issue.
I consider them linked.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
