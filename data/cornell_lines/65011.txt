You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
And do you amuse the guests?
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
You're drinking it.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Whatever you say.
I didn't say anything.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
