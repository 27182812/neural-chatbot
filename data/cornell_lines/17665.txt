Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
Oh, George . . .
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
I'd go mad!
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
