You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
That might be better than this.
