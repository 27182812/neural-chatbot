I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
No.  Did he really?
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
What?
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
