Why? Who are you?
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
No.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
I don't remember.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
You want to make it like this?
