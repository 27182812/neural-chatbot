What the fuck did you do that for?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
Jesus!
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
What?
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Please, get the hell out of here.
I know I'm your hero.
