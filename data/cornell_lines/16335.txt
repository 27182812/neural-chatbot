How long have I been here?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
What do you mean?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Sera...
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Me neither.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Sera you are crazy.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
