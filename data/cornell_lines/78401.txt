There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
