What news from our friends?
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
Freylag's stronghold?
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
