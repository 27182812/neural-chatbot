Are you sure?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
No.  I want this to be all ours.
