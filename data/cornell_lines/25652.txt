Elaine, it's Wednesday.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
When is she coming over?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
