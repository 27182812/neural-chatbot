I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
What?
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
What's that?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
Stop knowing me so well.
I know it's at the high end of our range --

But it's what we want.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
And it's a shorter commute.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
