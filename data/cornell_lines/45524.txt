Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Oh...Where does he live?
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
