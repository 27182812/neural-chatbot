Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Excuse me.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
