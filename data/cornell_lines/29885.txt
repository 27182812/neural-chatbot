Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
