You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.
