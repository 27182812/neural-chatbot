I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
I'm not sure I can.
It'll be fun, come on!
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
You do everything your parents tell you?
No.
Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!
