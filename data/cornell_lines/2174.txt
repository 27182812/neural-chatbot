I'm going completely crazy.
David!
What?!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
I'm not listening!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Shut up, you zombie!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Will you be quiet?!
