What's he saying now?
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...
What?
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
'82.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
