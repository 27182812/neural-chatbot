Father...
Rise, Mordred.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
