Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
That is correct.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
And he sent you to me?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Does your mother know you have come?
No, sir.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
