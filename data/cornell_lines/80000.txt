Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
