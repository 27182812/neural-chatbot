You know how the Sisters are.
You training to be a nun or something?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
I want to be a teacher.
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
In braids? That's right.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Man, you were a mess!
I can get home all right from here—
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
The moment I saw you.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
How would you've done it?
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
