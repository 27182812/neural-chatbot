You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Oh? There's proof now?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
