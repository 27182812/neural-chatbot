Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.
