I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
No costume.  No blackface.
