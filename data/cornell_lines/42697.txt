Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Where?
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
And I can't leave.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
Jess--you look good.
