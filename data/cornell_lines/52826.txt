It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
TOTALLY!
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
