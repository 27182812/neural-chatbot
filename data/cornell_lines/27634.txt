Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
