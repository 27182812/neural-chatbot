You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
