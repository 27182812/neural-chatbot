Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Like what?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
