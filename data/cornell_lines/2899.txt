Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I beg your pardon?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Excuse me?
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
