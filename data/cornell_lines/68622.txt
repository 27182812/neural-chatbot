I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Oh Sidney...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
