Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
Yes.
I figured I'd ask you...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
We don't know that.
Are you gonna kill him?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
How did it happen?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
How?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
You went in the apartment?
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
