About what?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I never said that.
You implied it.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Thank you.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Shut up.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Why not?
Because you act like a pig.
