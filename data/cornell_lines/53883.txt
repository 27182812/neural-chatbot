For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
I'm sure they will.
As friends -- always as friends.
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
If it came down to it what would you do?
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
