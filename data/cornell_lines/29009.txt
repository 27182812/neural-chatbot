How was it?
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was that Meredith?
Was who Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Why lie?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Or Tom and Peter even.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Peter, I... I...
And don't forget. I have the key.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
