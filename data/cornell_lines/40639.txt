I gotta go now, Dad.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
We'll be praying for you.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
We'll pray anyway.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
