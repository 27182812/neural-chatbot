Lydia?
Hello, darling.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
