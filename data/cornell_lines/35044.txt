Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
