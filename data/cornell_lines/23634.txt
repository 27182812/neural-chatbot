Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
Jesus
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
Please don't ask me to do this.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
