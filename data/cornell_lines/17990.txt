According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
How?
