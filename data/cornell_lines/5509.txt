If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
