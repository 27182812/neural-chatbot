You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
You got a real good memory, Star.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
What do you have to buy?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
What?
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
I know that, Star.
