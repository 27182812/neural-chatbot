God protect me.
Not from me, surely...
You... you're a beast!
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
And you... are you not also afraid?
I am afraid of nothing.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Protection?
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Like some vile toadstool.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Why have you brought me here?
To be my bride, of course.
I'd soon die.
