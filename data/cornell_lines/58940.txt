Wilson.
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
What?
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah, but I don't know --
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
No.
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
Yeah.
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
