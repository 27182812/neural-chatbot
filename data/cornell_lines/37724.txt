Good morning, Louise.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
... I see.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Yes. I've seen that done.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
