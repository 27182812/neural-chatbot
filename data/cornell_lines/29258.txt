When'd you quit smoking?
Luke didn't smoke.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Not any more.
Why not?
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Not at all.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
