Hello, Peter.
You sonofabitch!
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
By that time the game will be over.
I've figured out the message.
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
