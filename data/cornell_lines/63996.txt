So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Why, are you famous?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
How many was that?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
That's funny.
I thought so, too.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
