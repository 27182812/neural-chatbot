Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
