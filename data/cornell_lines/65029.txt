He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
You don't know who he is?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
Us?
All right--following me.
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Anything I can do about it?
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
Try not talking.
