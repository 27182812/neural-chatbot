I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.

How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I have a terrible confession.
Tell the doctor.
I don't like lamb.
