Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Yeah, I can see that.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Me?
You lived there. You know the city.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
