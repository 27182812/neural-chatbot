Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
