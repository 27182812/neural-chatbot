How were things between you and Frank?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes.
Though nicer than most?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
What was bugging Frank?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
