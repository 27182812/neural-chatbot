Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why don't you come back with me?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
