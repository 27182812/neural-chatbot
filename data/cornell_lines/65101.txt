Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I never notice the view after the first week.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I wouldn't know.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
A couple of hours.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
That must hurt.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Would that make me a heel?
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
The only answer I have for you.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Information.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
