Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Really?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh...
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Like what?
