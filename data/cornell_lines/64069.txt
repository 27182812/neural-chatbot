Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Uh-huh.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
Gimme another hint.
It's Richard Ripley.
