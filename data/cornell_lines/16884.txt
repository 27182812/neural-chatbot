I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Why call me?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Money?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
The garage.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
When's school over?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
