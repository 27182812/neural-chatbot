Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
