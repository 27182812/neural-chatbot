Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
You're not envious?
Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
