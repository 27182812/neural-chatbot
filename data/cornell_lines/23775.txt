Where?
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
You did.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
With that cast on -- you don't.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
