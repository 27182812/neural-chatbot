Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
