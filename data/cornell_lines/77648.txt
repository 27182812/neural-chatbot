Who?
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
