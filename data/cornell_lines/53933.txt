Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
