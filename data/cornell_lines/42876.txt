A deer?
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
You still carrying passengers?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
