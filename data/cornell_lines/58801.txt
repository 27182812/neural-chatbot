So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
I found you someone.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
I know...
Mom tell you to do this?
No.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.
Oh, great.
You do.
Yeah, right.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
