Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
