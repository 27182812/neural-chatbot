Same old Daniel.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Is that so?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
The big house?
The big house.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
