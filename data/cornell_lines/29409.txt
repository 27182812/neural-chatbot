It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Growing a beard...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
So they united.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Hear!
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Hear, hear!
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Take wing!
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
