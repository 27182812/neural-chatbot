You're home late... or should I say early?
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
I'll never live as a thief!
You're already a thief.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Shut up!
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I owe you nothing.
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
