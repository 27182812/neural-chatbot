Seven dwarfs?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
