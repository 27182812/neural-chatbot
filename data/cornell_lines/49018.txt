I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
There's no one else here.
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
