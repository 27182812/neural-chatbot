Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
