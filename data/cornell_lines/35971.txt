Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
No.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
