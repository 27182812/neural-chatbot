Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
