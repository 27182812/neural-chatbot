Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Okay.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Take a little walk with me, huh?
