Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes.
Oh, I don't have one.
Come again.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
How long have you been driving?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Could I see your registration?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Isn't this your vehicle?
No, no. I just took it.
Took it?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Your tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Lady, let me get this straight.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
