You make a nice couple.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
She's a friend of mine
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
What?
