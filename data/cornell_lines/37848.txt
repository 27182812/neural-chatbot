There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
What's he been in?
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
I'll protect you, Dollface.
