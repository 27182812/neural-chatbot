Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
I know so. He's a taker.
A what?
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
