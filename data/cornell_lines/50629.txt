You're a family man, Frankie?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
