Oh, uh-huh.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
You mean like "time flies"?
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years.
Nine years?
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
