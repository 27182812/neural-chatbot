Who's that?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
I'm okay.  What's up?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Are you sure?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
