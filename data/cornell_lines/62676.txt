I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Dixie McCoy
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
What are you talking about?
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
