Thank you.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
