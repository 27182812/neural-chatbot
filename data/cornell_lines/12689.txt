You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
That's it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
