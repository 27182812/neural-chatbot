Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
