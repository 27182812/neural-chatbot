Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
So tell me about the Times article.
What do you want to know?
No games, Irwin; give.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
Something maybe big.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Who by?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
