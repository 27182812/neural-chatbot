Take care of yourself out there...
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Bill...
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
And cut that out right now.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
As of this moment you're six years old...
