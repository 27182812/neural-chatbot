Did you think they were newlyweds?
I didn't notice them.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.
What?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Jesus, if someone had --
Nobody ever sees me.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
