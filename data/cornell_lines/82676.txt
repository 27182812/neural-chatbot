Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
