You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Sometime, but not like this.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Uh huh...
That does it...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
