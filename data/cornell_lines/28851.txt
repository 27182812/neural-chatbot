The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You think I scam?
You're unlucky.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
