We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I have no idea.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
