You shot Melanie?
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
Uh-huh.
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
