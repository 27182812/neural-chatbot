My God!
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
The monkey.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
A better friend.
I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
You came up here looking for the portal?
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
People make mistakes.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I know.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
