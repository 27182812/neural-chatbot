You just met me.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Not here.
I realize that.
Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
