Treason. Against whom?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
It matters not, he is thy king!
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
I do not confess.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
