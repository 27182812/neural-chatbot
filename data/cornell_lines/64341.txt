Damn that Charlie I
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Thank God for that.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
All right. But this better be good.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Evelyn, take her to her room!
