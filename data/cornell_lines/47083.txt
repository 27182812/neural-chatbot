What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
No. But he hands them over.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
