See, isn't this nice?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
