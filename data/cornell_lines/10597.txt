Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
So am I.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Give away food?
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Take grain away from the army?
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
