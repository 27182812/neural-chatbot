I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I'll take your word for it.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
