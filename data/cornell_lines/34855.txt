Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Worker!  Come back here now!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
