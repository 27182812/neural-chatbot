...  maybe three hours.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
What happened to them?
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
