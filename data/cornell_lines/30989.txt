No!
It's not suffering anymore.
You're horrible
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You don't have to kill it.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You ever think about killing another human being?
About as much as they think about killing me.
