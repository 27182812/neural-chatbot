Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
