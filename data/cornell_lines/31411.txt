Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Around here?  Why would they?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
