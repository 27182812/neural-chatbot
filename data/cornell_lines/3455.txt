Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
