What's the matter?
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
You were good.
How do you know?
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
