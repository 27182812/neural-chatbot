Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
