Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Technothugs?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
I can smell it.
