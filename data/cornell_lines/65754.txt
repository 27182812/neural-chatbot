Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Only if we ask him.
