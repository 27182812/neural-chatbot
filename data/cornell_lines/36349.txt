Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Another 'you'?
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
