There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
But I can throw it out of the window.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...but big.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Who cried that one?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
