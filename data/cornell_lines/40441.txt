It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
You are such a wet.
A what?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.

And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.

Oh, fuck you!
