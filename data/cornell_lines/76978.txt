Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
