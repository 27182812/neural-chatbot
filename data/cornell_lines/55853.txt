It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Can't you tell?
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
