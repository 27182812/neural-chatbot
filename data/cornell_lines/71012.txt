Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Sure. You’ve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you’re easy.
