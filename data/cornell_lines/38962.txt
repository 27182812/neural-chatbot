Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
