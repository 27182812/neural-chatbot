You son of a bitch. She's been here.
What are you talking about?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Jezuz Christ!
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
