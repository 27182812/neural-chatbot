You might loosen the straps then.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I'm not Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
