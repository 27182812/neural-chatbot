Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
What?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
