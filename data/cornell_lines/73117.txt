Hey!
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
No I quit.
Hey, you said you did a video?
Yup.
What's it about?
It's really not about anything.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud.
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Oh.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Your a nurse?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Any gunshot victims?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Sounds like a bummer.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Right now?
Yeah.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Now?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Okay, whatever you want.
