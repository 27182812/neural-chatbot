I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
It's not that simple.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
