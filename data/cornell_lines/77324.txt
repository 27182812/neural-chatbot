I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sure.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
You still got a map on you?
What?  Yeah.
