What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
I don't believe that.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Ten years ago.
Yes.
What happened?
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
What did he want?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
What did he say?
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Was that it?
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
You didn't take it.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Ten years later, here you are again.
Yes.  Here I am again.
