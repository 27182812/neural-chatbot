We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
