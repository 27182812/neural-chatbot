I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
I -- I can't.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
No. Not that either.
