Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
May I ask why...?
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
