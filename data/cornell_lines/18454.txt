Could I ask you a question?
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Still not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You think too much?
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
