I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
And Jonas?
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Where do you think Jerry is?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
I don't think so.
