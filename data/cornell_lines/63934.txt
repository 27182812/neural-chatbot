I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
How long were you with the girl?
Forty-five minutes.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
