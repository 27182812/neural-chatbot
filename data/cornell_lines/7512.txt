I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
It's okay, really.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Rockville Center.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Really? Because --
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I don't have one.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I like it.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I don't really know how --
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
I'm sure you would.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Yeah, I got it.
