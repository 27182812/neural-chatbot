You want me to what?
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
What are you talking about?
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
What's the first street?
