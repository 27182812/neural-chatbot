You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
It will not happen!
