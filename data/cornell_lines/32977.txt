Anything new develop?
Unfortunately, no.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
