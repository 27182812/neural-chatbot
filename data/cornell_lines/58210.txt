That you, boy?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
It's pay day, ain't it?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
