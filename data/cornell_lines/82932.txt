Will you miss me?
Very....very!
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Oh, nice.
I hope you like large weddings.
Whatever makes you happy.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
You're incorrigible!
Does that mean you love me?
You bet your boots it does.
