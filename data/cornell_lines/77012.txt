You took that money from Julia's hand.
I didn't.
Then what are you hiding?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
There!
