Want to tell me what happened?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Something like that.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
