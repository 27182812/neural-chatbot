Yes, sir?
A glass of champagne, please.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Yes, I am.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Bastia -- and you?
Ajaccio.
Have you been back recently?
