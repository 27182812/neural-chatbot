So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.

I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
You version of it.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.

It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
