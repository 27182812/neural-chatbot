As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
There weren't any voices.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
What do you mean by that?
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
