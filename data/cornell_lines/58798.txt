Nah.
Why not?
You might be the only one with a job.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
To do what you love.
I don't know sometimes.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
A horse?
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
