Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
