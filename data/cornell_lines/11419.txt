You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I've never heard of it.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Are you've seen it work cures?
Hundreds.
