I see you got the telegram.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
And  I love you, Pete!
