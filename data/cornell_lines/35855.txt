Why are you doing all this, what for?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
What's the Bugler?
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
A champion of lost causes huh?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
We_re not all running away
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
