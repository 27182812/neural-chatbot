Lyla's very nice.
Yes, she is.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
You told me that two hours ago.
