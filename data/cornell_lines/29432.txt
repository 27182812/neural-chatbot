They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How soon?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.
