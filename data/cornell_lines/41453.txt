What makes you think that?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Why can't we?
Not in your nature.
What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
