Assume away!
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
What do you mean?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
What did I do?
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
One night.
