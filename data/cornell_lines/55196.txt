Then God does not exist...
I have not spoken to him...
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
