Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
She's haze grey and underway...
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
So dump on me.
This has nothing to do with you.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Which is guy-speak for...
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
