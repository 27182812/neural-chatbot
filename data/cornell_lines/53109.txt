Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
