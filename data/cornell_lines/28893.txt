Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
What club?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
