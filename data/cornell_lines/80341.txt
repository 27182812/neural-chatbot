You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
I... didn't know where you lived.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
My name is John Ferguson.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
