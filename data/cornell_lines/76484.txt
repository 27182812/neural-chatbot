My rates...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.

Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
