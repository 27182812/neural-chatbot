So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
