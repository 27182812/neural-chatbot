Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Oh--a hundred times--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Will you leave me alone?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Baloney!
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
