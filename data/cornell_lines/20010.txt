Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
But you did come to me.
