Your boy, there--
Amado.
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
No--
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
