Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Yeah...?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Ok
