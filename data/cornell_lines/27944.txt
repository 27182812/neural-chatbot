What purpose does this serve?
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
No, I do not mind.
