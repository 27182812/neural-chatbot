Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Yes.
She's such a great photographer.
Hm.
So where should I put it?
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
The both of you.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
So how much do you hate her?
Big time.
