Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
