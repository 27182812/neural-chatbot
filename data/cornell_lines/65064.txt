I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?

You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
