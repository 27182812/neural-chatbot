The kid's sorry, Auggie.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
