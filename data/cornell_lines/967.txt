Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Fine...
