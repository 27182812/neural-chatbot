Kit...
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
Where do you fit?
