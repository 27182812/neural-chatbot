Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Why Edie, I—
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
I wish I knew, Edie, But—
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
