How'd you find me?
Wasn't that hard.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Too early to tell.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Lauren's not my wife.
Girlfriend?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Is the social studies class over for today?
Yeah...
