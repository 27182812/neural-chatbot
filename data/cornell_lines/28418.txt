The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
A grill pattern.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
