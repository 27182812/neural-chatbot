Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
That's right. We did.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
It's hard to explain.
Well, try, huh.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
There's nothing to expose.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
They're not interested, Jake.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Don't bother to call again, okay?
