I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
