Really?
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
