I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
I'm going to work.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Not very late.
You're going to work now?
Yes.
Can I ask you a question?
Uh-huh.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Yes.
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Me?
Yeah.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Really? Please?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
