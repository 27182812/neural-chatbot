What'd she say?
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
