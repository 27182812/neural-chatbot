Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Back? You're sending me back?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Death! Thank you!
Thank me next time you see me.
