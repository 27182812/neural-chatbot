But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
