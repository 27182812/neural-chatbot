Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.
We won't have to.
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
