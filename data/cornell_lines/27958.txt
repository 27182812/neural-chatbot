Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
How could I not?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
