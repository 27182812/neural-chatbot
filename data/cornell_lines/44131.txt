I just came to say goodbye.
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
I think that's for the best.
Good for you.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
