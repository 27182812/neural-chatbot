How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
I'm afraid so.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
No.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Hardly.
