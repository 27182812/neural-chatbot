Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
