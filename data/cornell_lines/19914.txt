Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
