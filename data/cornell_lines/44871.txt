Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yeah.
Well?
So?
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
What is the point?
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
