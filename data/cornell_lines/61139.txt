What about the wedding?
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
How near is she to death?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
How about a month from today?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Alright. A month. In a month.
A month from today?
Yeah.
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
