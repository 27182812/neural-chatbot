I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
What is it you do, Sami?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I see.   A master criminal.
Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
