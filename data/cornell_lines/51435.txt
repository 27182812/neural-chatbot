It's not what you think.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
