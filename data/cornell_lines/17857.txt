Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
Yeah --
And replace them with new ones.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Why?
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Whatever you say, John.
