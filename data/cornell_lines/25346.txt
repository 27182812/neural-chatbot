So what gems do you have in your collection?
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
