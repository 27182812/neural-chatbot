We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
