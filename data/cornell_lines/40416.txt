You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Wait!
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.

Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Time to do what?
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Yes.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
