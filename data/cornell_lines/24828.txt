I have been at the library.
But you're always at the library.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
I don't think that's so revealing.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I don't know.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I'm at sea, Jason.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
Devil worshippers!
