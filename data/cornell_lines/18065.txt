It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Well, you look it. You win?
Draw.
What's your record at?
5-5-1.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Yeah, sure.
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
