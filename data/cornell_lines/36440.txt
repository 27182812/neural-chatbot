Doesn't surprise me at all.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Pictures! Jesus!
