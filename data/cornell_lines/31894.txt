My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
They'll probably move at dawn.
