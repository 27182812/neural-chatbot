There must have been somebody.
I was too busy.
Nobody's too busy.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Thank you.
I don't mean Fernando.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
I never said that.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
