I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
I understand.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
I've got three big ones.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
