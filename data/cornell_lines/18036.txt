Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Yes, sir.
Is it a good room?
I can take you down there.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Not on me, sir.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
So?
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
All the suites are about the same.
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
What if I gave you forty?
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Thank you, sir.
Where's the place to go tonight?
As far as...?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Women?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
It's on West Broadway.
See you later.
