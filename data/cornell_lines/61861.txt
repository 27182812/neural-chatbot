Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Does it work?
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Boyfriend?
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
