Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
