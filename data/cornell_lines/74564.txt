Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
