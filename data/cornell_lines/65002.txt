Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
How careful should I be?
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
