I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
Dark ops?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
It is at that.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I never made that claim.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You were behind the door?
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
You would have done that?
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
