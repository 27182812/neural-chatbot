Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
Did he give you his politicians?
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
How will they come at you?
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Have you agreed on a meeting?
A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
