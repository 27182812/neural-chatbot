No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Act natural.
I was afraid you'd say that.
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
