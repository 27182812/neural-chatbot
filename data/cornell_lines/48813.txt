It's against my better Judgment...
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
I've done all I could with the laser.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
