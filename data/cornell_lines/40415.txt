What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
I'm looking for you, actually.
Am I in trouble or something?
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
What are you talking about?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Why?
To bring you... your birthright.
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
