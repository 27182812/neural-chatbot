You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
