Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Thank you.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
