They're coming.  Any minute.
Who?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
There's no one here.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
--How do you know about that?
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Were you there--how do you know?
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
I don't understand.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
