What now, my love?
Huh?
Big night coming up?
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Oh.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Don't you ever give up?
