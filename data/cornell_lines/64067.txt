Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
And is Foley a part of this?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Why's that?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
