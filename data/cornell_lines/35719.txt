How to make a buck!
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Because it's in English?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
But we are underground?
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
