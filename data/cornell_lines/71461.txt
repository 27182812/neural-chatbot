Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
I'll do my best.
So what's going to happen to you?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
Over and out.
