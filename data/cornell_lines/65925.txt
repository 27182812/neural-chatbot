He's inherited a fortune.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
