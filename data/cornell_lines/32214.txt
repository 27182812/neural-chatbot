The Good Witch...
Sailor... Lula loves you.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
But I'm wild at heart.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
