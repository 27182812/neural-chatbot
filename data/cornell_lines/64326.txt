I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
You don't?
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
