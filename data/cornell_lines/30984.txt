I can't.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Lieutenant...
Evan... or Maverick.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
The what?
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
What are you talking about?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Harmless!
Uh hum.
What if he's not?
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
