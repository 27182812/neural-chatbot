Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you.
