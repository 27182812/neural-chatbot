That's very nice.
I like you.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Sorry?
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
