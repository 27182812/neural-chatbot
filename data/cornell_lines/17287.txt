Yes. What is rent?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Off limits.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
No.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
Yeah. The deep South.
