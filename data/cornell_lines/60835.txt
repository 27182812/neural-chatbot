Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Then don't say it.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
To do what?
Sort it all out.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
A change of plans?
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Lovely.
