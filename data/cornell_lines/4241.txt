How you feelin' today?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
I know that.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
What I love.
Get a good picture in your mind.
