Are you all right?
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
How do I leave here?
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
I promise.
