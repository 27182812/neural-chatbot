Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Any criminal record?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
How does the family survive?
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
