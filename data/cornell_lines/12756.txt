Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
A dead one.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
That's not something to joke about.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
