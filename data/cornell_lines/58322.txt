What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
You have somebody else out there?
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
We was crossin' the river--
