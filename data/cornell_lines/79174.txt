Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
