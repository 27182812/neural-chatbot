Private Johnson!
Sergeant?
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I'm feeling okay--
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
You're testing me?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Yes, Sergeant.
