An accident at the mill?
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
What about her?
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Investigation of what?
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
In other words, I'm on trial.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.
