Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Whom did they choose?
Herr Sommer.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
