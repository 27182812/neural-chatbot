Thea, what's wrong?
The General threatened me.
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble —— the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
Well, tell, him.
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
He hates all my race.
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
