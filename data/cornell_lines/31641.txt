What is it Laura? What's wrong?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
