You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
You want me to go around --
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Well -- yes --
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Why not -- ?
How much?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Shake!
