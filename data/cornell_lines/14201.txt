I want to be your -- your wife.
Huh?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Yes.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
You do?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
No.
Do you want to sleep on it?
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Yes. Again.
