Hi.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
