I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Yes.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Very clever.
