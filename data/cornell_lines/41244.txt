How far off are you?
Five minutes.
Where do I turn?
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
We're gonna get there first.
How do you know?
Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
