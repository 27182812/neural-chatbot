Something seem unusual to you about that?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Let's check am out.
