...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
'Threw' you?  Where?
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
No.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
