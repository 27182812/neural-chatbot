I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
Jerry, I --
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
