The key!? She has the lost key!?
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
