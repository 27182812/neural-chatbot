You live here.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
I didn't realize I was out.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
That's my girl...  Lights.
