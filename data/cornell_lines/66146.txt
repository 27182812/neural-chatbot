Now you listen to me, Rose --
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
