<u>What did you do to me</u>?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
I don't know.
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So now you know.
So it's time to go home.
That's all I get?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Keep it.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
That'll be their second worst mistake.
