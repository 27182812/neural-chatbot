Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
So what happened?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
You must get lonely at times.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Woman friends, too?
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
