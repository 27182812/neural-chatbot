This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
Yes?
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
No, I wasn't aware...
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
