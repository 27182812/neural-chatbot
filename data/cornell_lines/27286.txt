Status report, Admiral!
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
"Neutralized?" How?
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Can you protect us?
We are launching everything we have.
