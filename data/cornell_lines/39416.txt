You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
What building?
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
I didn't sell it.
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
