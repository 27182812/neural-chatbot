Oh. Of course... sorry.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
I have... did it sound that bad?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
George...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Thanks...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
