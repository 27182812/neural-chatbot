Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
