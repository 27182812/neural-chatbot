Jesus, what happened to you?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
What happened?
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
