I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
