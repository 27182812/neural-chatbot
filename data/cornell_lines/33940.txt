Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Five hundred; six maybe.
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?

Give me your checkbook then.
It's right under that pile.
