Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
