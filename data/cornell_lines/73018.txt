I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
