No, please; an advance on your salary.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
You must be very rich.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
I only meant...
These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
And how rusty are these muskets?
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
