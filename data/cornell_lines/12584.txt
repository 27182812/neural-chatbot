A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Very simple, Earl.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
