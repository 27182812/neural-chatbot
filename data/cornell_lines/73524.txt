Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Frankly, no.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
