Can I help you?
You might hold this for me.
Love to.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
How long does it take a man to land?
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
