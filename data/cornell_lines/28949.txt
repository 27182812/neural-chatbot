I was looking forward to seeing him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
That's a terrific idea.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
