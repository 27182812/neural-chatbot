I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
You're impossible....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
The plane's turning....
