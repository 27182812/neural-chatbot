Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
And that's why you never went pro?
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Not yet.
