Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
You and 'Honey'?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
I'm sorry --
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
What's the way?
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
Why?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
So you're a one-girl guy?
Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
