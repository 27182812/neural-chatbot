I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Yes, you do. You do.
