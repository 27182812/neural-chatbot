Come on, Will.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
No. Why?
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Let's stay here, Will.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
