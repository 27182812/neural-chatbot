You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Is your brother a flyer?
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
Yeah.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
We don't have to talk at all.
