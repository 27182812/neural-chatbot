What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
