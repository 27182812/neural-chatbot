What did it smell like?
It was very specific.
All right...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
What happened after you smelled it?
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
And then what happened?
I got more scared.
