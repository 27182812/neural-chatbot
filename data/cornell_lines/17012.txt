Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
What gave you that idea?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Reward?
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
