This Jimmy's?
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Who did?
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
