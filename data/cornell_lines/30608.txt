Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
