We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
