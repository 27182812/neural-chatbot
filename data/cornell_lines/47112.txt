You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
I don't think so.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
I'll come with you.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
