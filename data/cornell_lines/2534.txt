Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Really!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
I can completely understand your distress, sir.
