Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
They fought against the Indians?
Same as they done in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You know who I am?
I got a pretty good guess.
That guy who got shot--
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
PDA?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Well--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Didn't have a father?
He's still pissed off about it.
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
