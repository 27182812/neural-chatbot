You wanna get some coffee?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
So what book did you buy?
Oh, it's nothing.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
It's stupid.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
