You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
... My ... social situation?
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
