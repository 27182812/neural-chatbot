Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Thank you.
Nice to have you here.
Great to be here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
