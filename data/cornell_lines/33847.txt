I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
You'd have been proud of her.
I'm sure.
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
What do you mean?
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
That's beside the point.
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
