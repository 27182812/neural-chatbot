So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
What kind of animal?
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
