I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
How do you know she did that?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
