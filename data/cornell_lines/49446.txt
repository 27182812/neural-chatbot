Congressional Medal of Honor.
Yeah.  Big time.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
What did you want?
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
