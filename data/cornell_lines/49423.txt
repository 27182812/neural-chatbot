Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
What's the plan?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
We just take pictures?
Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.
