What are you going to tell the little ones?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
