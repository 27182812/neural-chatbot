What is thy bidding, my Master?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Yes, my Master.
